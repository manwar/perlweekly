      "It was my go to page for finding <strong>CPAN</strong> distributions until <strong>June, 2018</strong>, when the service was unfortunately shut down. That's when I switched to <a href=\"https://metacpan.org\">MetaCPAN</a>. Over time, I've come to truly appreciate its power, thanks to the dedicated team of volunteers working tirelessly to keep it running smoothly.",
      "Honestly, I never realised how much effort and time went into maintaining such a vast repository of informations, until I spent a few days with the core team at <strong>PTS2025</strong>, I have immense respect for their work. It's disheartening to hear complaints when the service is slow or down. Instead of criticising, I wish more people would step up to help. That way, they'd gain a deeper appreciation for what it takes to keep <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> alive.",
      "Speaking of community efforts, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> made a public call for help to upgrade <a href=\"https://www.perl.com\">perl.com</a> from an older version of <strong>Hugo</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1kufqfj/how_is_your_hugo\">(see reddit post here)</a>. Incredibly, there's already a <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/perldotcom/pull/446\">pull request</a> waiting for review, what a turnaround.",
      "I just realised that I've completed <strong>seven years</strong> as co-editor of the <strong>Perl Weekly Newsletter</strong>. I joined the team back in <strong>May, 2018</strong>. Time flies, incredible!",
      "Today is bank holiday in England, so I'm taking it easy. Enjoy the newsletter."
