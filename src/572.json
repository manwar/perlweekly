      "Hi there,",
      "Are you a <strong>Perl</strong> blogger?",
      "The state of Perl blogging is not hidden from anyone. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> wrote an extensive <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl\">blog post</a> explaining not just the issues but also suggestions to get around it.",
      "I proposed an idea on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpan_author\">personal twitter</a> handle and asked for public opinion. As of today, it got <strong>22 likes</strong>. I know, it isn't big number.",
      "By the way, what was the proposal?",
      "The proposal was to setup dedicated domain (https) powered by <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. The static site would be generated by <strong>Hugo</strong>. It would be open to public to submit blog post as <strong>Markdown</strong> formatted page as pull request. After a quick review, the post would be live.",
      "Sounds simple, isn't it?",
      "The proposal should be familiar to those who have ever wrote an article for <a href=\"https://www.perl.com\">Perl.com</a>. It has the same the process as I mentioned above, I was reminded the same in response to my <strong>Twitter post</strong> by a friend of mine. It makes me sad to see that the last post on the site was published on <strong>25th May 2021</strong>. I came to know about the site for the first time when I found out about the monthly post <strong>\"What's new on CPAN\"</strong> by <strong>David Farrell</strong>. In the early days of my <strong>CPAN</strong> association, every time I upload a new distribution, I would wait for the article to see if my distribution made it or not. Some of my distributions did appear in the article, just for record. I even did interview series, <strong>The Perl Ambassador</strong> for the site in the year 2020. I had the honour to interview, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo\">Gabor Szabo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe\">Curtis 'Ovid' Poe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway\">Damian Conway</a>. What a shame, I couldn't continue even though I had the list of high profile <strong>Perl Ambassadors</strong> to interview.",
      "I have mostly blogged on <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar\">blogs.perl.org</a>. I don't consider myself an active blogger, although I used to blog frequetly before. I don't feel comfortable now a days blogging on <strong>bpo</strong>, so I decided to blog on <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> and cross linked on <strong>bpo</strong>. It is (cross linking) something not approved by many as I understand. I am likely to setup my personal blog site instead, just for <strong>Perl</strong>. I will share the details when it is live. You are all welcome to contribute.",
      "I am up for new ideas and suggestions too. Please do share if you have one.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
