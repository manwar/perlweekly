      "Hi there,",
      "Do you remember the first programming language you picked up?",
      "I am sure in the life span of a programmer, one picks more than one programming language but still have special place for one. I remember during my first encounter in the year <strong>1993</strong>, I was introduced to <strong>COBOL</strong> as part of the course I joined immediately after getting through <strong>12th or (+2 as some remember)</strong>. I had only access to PC at the institute and that too 2 times a week for one hour each. Imagine relying on books and nothing else, I was attracted towards many other programming languages. During that period, I picked up <strong>Fortran</strong> as well and I loved it more than <strong>COBOL</strong>. When I got bored of <strong>Fortran</strong>, I went to <strong>Pascal</strong>. That too didn't last long before I moved to <strong>C</strong>. I stayed with <strong>C</strong> longer than any of the programming languages I picked before. I remember when I moved to <strong>Mumbai</strong> for a better opportunity in the year <strong>1997</strong>, I hardly got any offer so I took a part-time job to build a desktop application for a small factory using <strong>FoxPRO</strong>. It was during this period, I got the offer to join a startup looking for fresher willing to learn <strong>Perl</strong>. It was my first proper job as a programmer. Infact, I was given two choices, <strong>Perl</strong> or <strong>Java</strong>. I choose <strong>Perl</strong> as it was easier to move from <strong>C</strong>. And here I am today, in the year <strong>2023</strong>, working as a <strong>Perl Developer</strong>.",
      "Reason I am sharing my story is last week I came across some post on social media talking about (again) <strong>Perl</strong> is dead or not moving fast enough to keep up with the younger generations. I don't want to repeat what is said in favour or against <strong>Perl</strong> but it pains to see not many coming forward to stop the lies. I remember when <strong>Perl v5.36</strong> was released, it made a big impact and everyone started talking about it. I even did daily series on the new features of latest release. I have kept it recorded in the <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a> for anyone to have a look. In few months time, there is going to be another big release that every <strong>Perl</strong> fans are looking forward to it. So to all ignorants and haters, <strong>Perl</strong> is not going anywhere and will remain stronger as ever.",
      "Just for fun, I asked <strong>ChatGPT</strong> his views on <strong>Perl</strong>. I must say it didn't dissappoint me. It tried to be polite and diplomatic in his response. I liked it. Please don't get me wrong, I don't live in the fantasy world. I know the fact, we don't have many new projects being developed in <strong>Perl</strong>. So what? That doesn't make it any lesser than others. You can try other while still in love with <strong>Perl</strong>. I am not suggesting you do but if you do then there is nothing wrong in it. I know many experts in <strong>Perl</strong> equally good in many other languages. You can find them doing <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">weekly challenges</a> in so many different languages.",
      "The moral of the story, <strong>Perl</strong> will remain my first love no matter what. How about you, <strong>Perl</strong> fans?",
      "Last but not the least, <strong>Enlightened Perl Organisation (EPO)</strong> is closing down, <strong>Mark Keating</strong> made it public the <a href=\"https://ww2.enlightenedperl.org/2023/02/27/closing-down\">sad news</a>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank <strong>Mark Keating</strong> and his entire team for all the hard work and support, specially to the <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong>.",
