     "Opensource contributions season is about to start with <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com\">Hacktoberfest</a> tomorrow. It would continue the whole month, enough time for you to contribute to opensource projects. Although I have registered to be part of this year event but I doubt to have time for contribution unfortunately.",
     "For me, I am looking forward to the most awaited event, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024\">London Perl & Raku Workshop 2024</a>. It is happening after a long gap of <strong>5 years</strong>. If you are planning to attend the event then I would suggest you register your details as it would help the organiser to manage the event smoothly.",
     "There is another <strong>Perl Conference</strong> that I completely missed and it was <a href=\"https://perl-conf.ru/24\">Perl-Conf.Ru</a>. The first Perl developers conference in <srong>Russia</strong> in <strong>four years</strong>.",
