     "Hi there",
     "The facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Perl Programmers</a> has launched the Perl Mentoring program recently. Dean, one of the Mentor himself, shared the finer details in this <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2020/07/perl-mentoring.html\">blog</a>. I would highly recommend if you are new to Perl and want to learn from the expert then please join the program as Mentee. I am sure you would benefit from the experience of highly capable Mentors.",
     "I follow Curtis blog very closely and never misses any of his technical blog. So what is new this time? This time, Curtis shared his point of view on Git Workflow. In the <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/easy-git-workflow.html\">blog</a>, he discussed about git-flow, one of many popular workflow. I would recommend you must check out the blog if you deal with Git on a daily basis.",
     "Has anyone come across \"Script Repository\" just like CPAN for module? Recently someone shared this <a href=\"https://www.cpan.org/scripts/index.html\">link</a> on Facebook. I must confess, I wasn't aware of it before. I doubt if it is being looked after. I am not sure, if TPF would be interested in keeping it alive and up to date. I, personally, would like to see it become talk of the town. But then it is my personal view. Also do I have time for any new responsibility? For this, I could probably find the time. You know me, don't you?",
    "Last but not the least, don't loose the focus and stay alert. We are not out of danger yet. Please look after yourself and your loved ones. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
