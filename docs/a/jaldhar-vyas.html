   Jaldhar shared really nice tricks with regard to the Christmas day task. "Christmas always falls on December the 25th which is exacly one week before New Years Day of the next year. So if we know the next New Years Day is on a Sunday, we know Christmas is on a Sunday. How do we know which day of the week New Years Day is on? Well, January 1, 2019 was on a Tuesday. January 1, 2020 will be on the next consecutive day of the week i.e. Wednesday. For each subsequent year we increment the day of week by one. The only stumbling block is for leap years which have an extra day. So for the year after a leap year, we have to increment by two."

   Offers elegant solutions in Raku and also provides working Perl equivalents. It balances code with commentary.

   Solutions leaned toward succinct, readable Perl and Raku idioms. The variety of strategies—regex, loops, data structures—showing the languages’ flexibility.

   Both solutions demonstrate clean, idiomatic Perl/Raku style. The regex-based "Last Word" solution very neatly captures the core requirement in one line. Meanwhile, the "Buddy Strings" solution is methodical, explicit and covers all special cases.

   The Raku version shows off the expressive power of high-level language features (like Bag and junctions) in a tight one-liner. The Perl version is longer but more transparent to a general audience, especially Perl learners.

   These solutions demonstrate deep understanding of both problem domains and Perl programming, making them excellent reference implementations. The mathematical approach to Task 1 is particularly noteworthy for its robustness, while the concise functional solution to Task 2 showcases Perl's expressiveness.
