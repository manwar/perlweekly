      "Hi there",
      "For those who have had the opportunity to be part of Pull Request Challenge organised by Neil Bowers should be aware that we now have Pull Request Club running successfully since January 2019. Thanks to its creator Kivanc Yazan. It is still very much in early stages. I am sure Kivanc would love to hear any suggestions.",
      "I remember during Pull Request Challenge days, there were few organisations participated as a group and worked on alloted distribution. I knew, one such group, CV-Library. I was wondering if something similar is happening with Pull Request Club. If not then I would request them to join the club and contribute like before.",
      "Last but not the least, if anyone needs helping hand then please get in touch with me.",
      "Finally enjoy reading this week newsletter and don't forget to share with your friends."
