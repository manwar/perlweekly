      "Hi there,",
      "Belated <strong>Happy Ramadan</strong> to those who celebrate the holy month.",
      "To me and most of us, <strong>TPF</strong>, is the parent body who supports the language. With the emergence of <strong>Raku</strong>, it is now referred as <strong>TPRF (The Perl and Raku Foundation)</strong>. There have been many positive changes brought by the parent body. One of them is the creation of <strong>Perl Steering Council</strong> and we even get the weekly update too. You can checkout the latest update from <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2023/03/this-week-in-psc-102.html\">PSC</a>.",
      "The change in name reminds me when I had to change the name <strong>Perl Weekly Challenge</strong> to <strong>The Weekly Challenge</strong> to accommodate <strong>Raku</strong> and many other languages. Even today, I use the term <strong>Team PWC</strong> as I find it hard to move on. The best part is the team shares ideas from other languages. A fellow <strong>Team PWC</strong> member, <strong>Cheok-Yin Fung</strong> started series where she talks about popular and usefull <strong>CPAN</strong> module. Latest in the series is about <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2023/03/graph---weekly-travelling-in-cpan.html\">Graph</a>. If you like the idea then do share your comments and encourge her. I am so proud of her. I would also like to mention about the work recently done by <strong>Dave Cross</strong> i.e. <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2023/03/improvements-to-planet-perl-and-perlanet\">Improvements to Planet Perl and Perlanet</a>.",
      "I am looking forward to the next big stable release of <strong>Perl</strong> which would bring the new shiny OO concept, <strong>Corinna</strong> among many other features. Ideally I would want to have <strong>v7</strong> as it was suggested many years ago. I have no clue if anything is happening on that front.",
      "If you look at the positive noises on so many social platforms, I am confident we are going to bounce back soon. We have best of the best talent, we just need guidance. I am sure, <strong>TPF</strong> can help us on that front too. So all you <strong>Perl Hackers</strong>, please don't loose hope. We would bring back the glory we once had. For now enjoy all the <strong>Perl</strong> goodies in the newsletter."
