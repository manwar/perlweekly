      "Hi there",
      "If you remember, I mentioned Outreachy program in the editorial of the weekly newsletter edition <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/522.html\">#522</a>. It has finally come to an end as Rosheen Naeem successfully completed the internship as reported by the TPF in the <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/outreachy2021-complete\">blog</a>. Congratulation Rosheen.",
      "The Perl Foundation is looking for mentors and project ideas for the next Outreachy rounds. If you have Perl or Raku project ideas, please get in touch with TPF.",
      "Many years ago, I was reached out for help by the Open Food Facts team as they found out about my distribution, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/Food-ECodes\">Food::ECodes</a>. Unfortunately it didn't work out as I was too busy with my other pet projects. I hope one day I can contribute to <a href=\"https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server\">Open Food Facts</a>. I remember I had trouble setting up local development environment for contribution. I haven't had chance to see if any improvement done in this regard to help newcomers to contribute.",
      "I request Perl fans to come forward and help the cool fun project Open Food Facts.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter and stay safe."
