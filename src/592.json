      "Hi there,",
      "We all know not many people blog about <strong>Perl</strong> anymore. Are we doing anything to get it back on track? Well, unfortunately again, nothing is happening on that front either.",
      "But, hey, there is still hope and handful of <strong>Perl</strong> fans doing their best. One of them is our chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. He has been running <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com\">Perl Maven</a> for years now and many of us benifitted from his work. He recently started blogging on <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab\">Dev.To</a>. I request all the <strong>Perl</strong> fans to follow him and like blog post. I didn't have the account there before so I decided to create <a href=\"https://dev.to/manwar\">personal account</a>. Although I no longer blog at all but this is going to change soon. Earlier I used to blog on <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar\">blogs.perl.org</a> but then I moved to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">The Weekly Challenge</a> recently.",
      "Talking about blogging, how can I miss one name, <strong>Flavio Poletti</strong>? He has been blogging daily for years now. Feel free to check out his <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY\">work here</a>. Kudos to him for his effort.",
      "I would like to mention another name, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>, for his hard work in reviving the good old friend, <a href=\"https://perladvent.org\">Perl Advent Calendar</a>. <strong>Julien</strong> has been helping him in the project too. I remember there was a <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2022/07/21/the-perl-advent-calendar-2022-call-for-papers-is-now-open\">call for papers</a> by him. If you have time and something to share about your favourite <strong>CPAN</strong> module then please do contribute. I have booked one slot for myself for this year <strong>Advent Calendar</strong>. Hopefully, I will submit my article on time.",
      "Last but not the least, I would like to thank all the members of <strong>Team PWC</strong> for creating friendly and positive vibes for years now. As of today, they have published <strong>3000+ blog posts</strong> sharing creative ideas and solutions. If you are interested then please do checkout <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/recaps\">blog posts</a>.",
