     "Hi there",
     "We lost, <strong>Zefram</strong>, a very respectable and prolific contributor to <strong>Perl</strong> core. The sad news was shared on <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2025/03/msg269672.html\">P5P</a>. He was a regular attendee of the <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong>. Although I never interacted with him personally,  I always followed his contributions on <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/author/ZEFRAM\">MetaCPAN</a>. I also found his <a href=\"https://www.fysh.org/~zefram\">web space</a> where his works are nicely logged. Additionally, there is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZBYRT5Ghc\">YouTube video</a> of him presenting at the <strong>London Perl Workshop 2015</strong>.",
     "<strong>Perl Toolchain Summit 2025</strong> is happening from <strong>May 1 to May 4, 2025</strong>. Hosting such event is only possible because of the generous sponsors, as <a href=\"https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2025/sponsors.html\">listed here</a>. Speaking of sponsors, <strong>Deriv</strong>, is one name you'll find at most <strong>Perl</strong> gatherings. There is a <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/why-deriv-supports-the-perl-ecosystem\">dedicated post</a> that details why? I remember when <strong>Booking.com</strong> used to be everywhere and was often the first to sponsor. Finding a sponsor in current environment is really tough, all credit goes to the team working tirelessly behind the scenes.",
     "I have a firsthand experience in seeking sponsors for my pet project: <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. I was lucky enough to find our first sponsor, <strong>Perl Careers</strong> (by <strong>Pete Sergeant</strong>) without much effort. After a long term sponsorship, he stopped it about <strong>2 years</strong> ago. Fortunately, we immediately found another generous sponsor, <strong>Lance Wicks</strong>, who has been our solo sponsor ever since. In both cases, I didn't actively seek out sponsors, they found us. The main obstacle we face is that we are not a registered organisation. It remains a one-man organisation, and I lack the experience to run a registered organisation entity.",
     "As <strong>Ramadan</strong> continues, today marks <strong>Day 17 of Ramadan</strong> and I find my routine slightly disrupted. Not that I am complaining, it is just that my sleep pattern has changed. I don't need to emphasize, <strong>How important is sleep.</strong> I have learned that the hard way. However, there is a positive side to this change in routine. It has given me time to re-visit my <strong>TODO</strong> list. There was a time when I used to blog regularly but then I stopped completely. I don't know if you've noticed but I've started writing again. Below are some of my recent posts, in case you missed any.",
