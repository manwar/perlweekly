      "The Hacktoberfest 2018 is the 5th Edition. I am always surprised by the popularity of the event. Sometimes I wonder, why can't this be repeated every month of the year, instead of just October. Those who don't know what I am talking about, The Hacktoberfest challenge is an annual event run by @DigitalOcean, where you are encouraged to submit at least 5 Pull Request to any distribution hosted on GitHub in the month of October. In return you will receive specially designed FREE T-Shirt delivered to you anywhere in the world.",
