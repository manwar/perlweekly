     "Hi there,",
     "I remember when I started <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>, I used to refer to <strong>Perl</strong> as <strong>Perl 5</strong> just to differentiate it from <strong>Perl 6</strong>, which is now called <strong>Raku</strong>. Ever since <strong>Perl 6</strong> became <strong>Raku</strong>, I went back to simply calling it <strong>Perl</strong>.",
     "During the <strong>London Perl Workshop 2024</strong>, I heard the whispers about the proposal of change in <strong>version</strong> but no details were available at the time to my knowledge. Before I talk about it, let me share this <strong>GitHub</strong> repository for <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/PPCs\">Proposed Perl Changes (PPCs)</a>. Anyone curious to know what is happening or in the pipeline, can easily get the update here. Not only that, you can even submit a feature request too. While going through the list of proposals, I came across this proposal for <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0025-perl-version.md\">Perl version</a>. A big round of applause to <strong>Aristotle Pagaltzis</strong> for such a detailed document that dives into the finer points. You must checkout the document yourself, in case I missed any important bits. As far as my understandings, in the next <strong>Perl</strong> stable release the <strong>Perl</strong> version would be <strong>42.0</strong>. I'd be surprised if it goes without any arguments and counter arguments. If you ask for my personal opinion, I'm happy with the proposal. I hope the transition will be smooth.",
     "As we reach the end of <strong>November</strong>, two annual events are approaching: the <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> and <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 PullRequests</a>. Personally, I'm looking forward to the <a href=\"https://cfp.perladvent.org\">Perl Advent Calendar 2024</a> as it will be celebrating its <string>25th year</strong>. To make it special, there is a planned presentation, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/randal-schwartz-half-my-life-with-perl\">Half My Life with Perl</a> by <strong>Randal Schwartz</strong>. It will be live streamed via Zoom and you can <a href=\"https://lu.ma/giz69577\">register</a> for the event, if you're interested.",
     "There is also one more event, <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/11/registration-is-open---perl-community-conference-winter-2024.html\">Perl Community Conference, Winter 2024</a> scheduled for <strong>18th December</strong>. It will be in a hybrid format.",
