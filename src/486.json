      "Hi there",
      "I have been asked this question many times. And I always find it hard to answer this question. Recently I came across a post on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Facebook</a> started this discussion once again. I am pleasantly surprised by some of the response to this question.",
      "I am sure you must have come across, <a href=\"http://cpandashboard.com/\">CPAN Dashboard</a>, by Dave Cross. I loved the idea. I have yet to try it myself. I am certainly going to get my hand dirty soon. If you are CPAN module author then please give it a go and share your experience with us. Let us make this as popular as CPAN itself.",
      "On a similar note, Gabor Szabo, started project <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/cpan-digger\">CPAN Digger</a>. I still remember many years ago, Gabor shared the idea with me and wanted me to work on this. Unfortunately I never got around to it. I am so happy that it is finally arrived. It would be great if we all come along and help with the project.",
      "A recent <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/samir_parikh/2020/11/perl-podcasts.html\">post</a> by Samir Parikh, brought the topic \"Perl Podcast\" once again. I still remember, Lance Wicks and I, discussed the subject during the Perl Conference in Glasgow in 2018. We even recorded of our first interview together with a very popular face in the Perl commnunity. What a shame, I couldn't give the attention it needed. I am still hopeful one day we will get it back in action.",
      "Last but not the least, how is various form of lockdown treating you in your own country? Please do look after yourself and your family. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
