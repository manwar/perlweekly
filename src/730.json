     "Hi there,",
     "We all know the loss of brilliant mind, <strong>Matt S Trout</strong>. I am still recovering from it. <strong>RIP</strong>, my friend.",
     "Everytime I come across this: <strong>*1983 - 2025*</strong>, it reminds me of my birth year <strong>*1975*</strong>.",
     "<a href=\"https://metacpan.org\">MetaCPAN</a> seems to be running smoothly as shared in this <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2025/07/metacpan-running-really-well-thanks.html\">post</a> by <strong>Dean</strong>. Anyone interested in the work done can find the documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-k8s/issues/154\">here</a>.",
     "The recently concluded <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference 2025</strong> videos are now public on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA\">YouTube</a>. Of all of them, one of my favourites is the talk about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTj-lT2Y40\">Dancer2</a> by <strong>Jason Crome</strong>.",
     "As you know, we had the development release <strong>Perl v5.42.0-RC1</strong> on <strong>June 25, 2025</strong>. In case you missed it, here is the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/CONTRA/perl-5.42.0-RC1/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">delta page</a> listing all the changes in the release. A week later, we had the maintenance release <strong>Perl v5.42.0</strong> on <strong>July 3, 2025</strong>. Again, we have a dedicated <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/BOOK/perl-5.42.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">delta page</a> for this release.",
     "<strong>What's your favourite change in this release?</strong>",
     "For me, I liked the support for <strong>lexical method</strong> in the experimental class feature. I'm aware, there are many other importants improvements and bug fixes as well. A big <strong>Thank You</strong>, to <strong>Perl Development Team</strong>.",
     "<strong>What's next in the pipeline?</strong>",
     "Well, if you ask me, I'm still waiting for support for <strong>roles</strong> in the experimental class feature. I've heard some whispers that it's in the pipeline. I'm glad it has not been pushed aside. I'm hoping the next stable release will bring good news, fingers crossed!",
     "<strong>What are you working on these days?</strong>",
     "I'm mostly working on <strong>AWS</strong> related services these days as my day job revolves around them. I'm super excited to be working under the guidance of <strong>Andrew Solomon</strong> from <a href=\"https://geekuni.com\">GeekUni</a>. Whenever I explore something new, I create a public post about my experience, viewing it through the lens of <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.",
     "It's not always about <strong>AWS</strong>, my last post was about <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/lexical-method-v542\">Lexical Method in Perl v5.42</a>. I know, it's been nearly a month now but I'm currently working on a blog post about <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>. My experience so far has been a bit mixed. The native support for <strong>Perl</strong> in <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> is not as robust as <strong>Python</strong>'s. After spending a few nights on it, I finally gave up. I'm happy creating lambda function in <strong>Python</strong> and then calling them programatically from <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.",
     "The most fun part is when the lambda function is stored in an <strong>S3 bucket</strong>. Then there's another twist, using <strong>APIGateway</strong> to call lambda function. I use <strong>LocalStack (the free version)</strong> as a local platform. Unfortunately, the <strong>free</strong> version doesn't have all the features enabled, but it's still good enough to get my hand dirty.",
     "My go-to <strong>CPAN</strong> module for all <strong>AWS</strong> related services is <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws\">Paws</a>. I must admit, it's been rock solid.",
     "Apart from <strong>AWS</strong>, I'm also working on blog posts about </strong>DBIC</strong>, <strong>ElasticSearch</strong>, <strong>Caching</strong> and <strong>Serialisation</strong> in <strong>Perl</strong>. Some are nearly finished, they just need a final touch-up before going public. You can track all my experiments on my <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">personal blog page</a>.",
        "I noticed a nee section titled <strong>\"Sponsors\"</strong> added to the newsletter by <strong>Gabor</strong>. It did the trick for me and brought in one additional sponsor last week, taking the total count to <strong>35 sponsors</strong>. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each and every sponsor for their generous support. Thank you, <strong>Gabor</strong> for the initiative!",
        "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and take extra care of yourself."
