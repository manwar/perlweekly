     "<strong>Let us all welcome the new year with Hope and Positivity.</strong>",
     "As we bid farewell to the past year, we step forward into a new chapter full of fresh opportunities and untapped potential. The dawn of a new year brings with it a promise of new beginnings, a chance to turn the page on challenges faced and to embrace the joys that lie ahead.",
     "As we all know, we just celebrated <strong>25 years</strong> of <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>, of all the <strong>24 gifts</strong> we had this year, my favourite ones: <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html\">Half My Life with Perl</a> and <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html\">A New Logo for Perl</a>. As far as the live stream of <strong>Randal Schwartz</strong>, we were all notified in advance but the surprise entry was the announcement of new <strong>Camel for Perl</strong>. As per the tradition, we have a public repository where anyone can share ideas and comments: <a href=\"https://github.com/metacpan/perl-assets\">perl-assets</a>. There is even a public channel, <a href=\"https://app.slack.com/client/T2VEZKFPG/C05KBHFH1AA\">#perl-logo</a> under the <strong>perlfoundation</strong> slack workspace where you can discuss the subject with others. The <a href=\"https://www.perl.org\">perl.org</a> site has already adopted the new logo. It is also used in the <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org\">Perldoc</a> website. <strong>OpenCage</strong> also used the new logo in the <a href=\"https://opencagedata.com/tutorials\">tutorials section</a>.",
     "Talking about <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>, there is another very popular project: <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com\">Advent of Code</a>. I came across one very <a href=\"https://blog.aschoch.ch/posts/aoc-2024\">special contribution</a> where the contributor used <strong>25 different programming languages</strong> where we had one entry for <a href=\"https://blog.aschoch.ch/posts/aoc-2024#19\">Perl</a> as well.",
     "For all, <strong>London Perl Mongers</strong> fan, we now have a <a href=\"https://londonperl.org\">new home</a>, thanks to <strong>Dave Cross</strong> for taking the initiative. I hope we resume the regular meetup too.",
     "Last but not least, please do take care of your physical and mental health. Enjoy rest of the newsletter,"
