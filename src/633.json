      "Hi there,",
      "Finally I am back editing the weekly newsletter. As you all know I share the responsibilities with the chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. I usually do the <strong>even</strong> numbered week and he does the <strong>odd</strong> one. Having said, I was off the job for sometime because of health issues, I decided to take <strong>odd</strong> numbered week i.e. <strong>633</strong> to make a comeback. From next week onwards, I will be back to the routine. I would like to take this opportunity to thank <strong>Gabor</strong> for all the help and support.",
      "Today is <strong>9/11</strong>, people all around the world remember this day with different emotions. I still remember the event, I was sitting with my team in a small office in central London. Around lunch time local time, we got the news. The team was made up with Iraqi, Indian, Pakistani and Enlish. So you can imagine the mixed reactions? For me, it is a very special day as I got married on this day <strong>20 years</strong> ago. I choose this day so that I would never miss the most important day of my life.",
      "Coming back to <strong>Perl</strong>, I have been out of touch with it for the longest period. Thanks to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The [Perl|Weekly] Challenge</a>, I was holding the ground and stay in touch with the magical power of <strong>Perl</strong>. There was a time, I used to be active and available to help anyone with <strong>Perl</strong> related queries. With passing time, I find it hard to cope with the work load. I recently saw this <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/olafalders_im-looking-to-pick-up-some-extra-weekend-activity-7105556888615858176-1BAB\">post</a> by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>. It feels nice to see so much help available.",
      "Post release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, I saw jump in activities among the <strong>Perl</strong> fans but there is still some not so positive vibes going around which makes me very sad. There is clearly two groups, one is very vocal in sharing personal opinions and the other is not so vocal but allow free speach. I happen to see both sides on daily basis and wish we had one platform where we can share our experience with <strong>Perl</strong>. This would have help sending one strong voice to the young generations and welcome to the community.",
      "Recently concluded, <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto</strong> was a great event where I met so many young and enthusiastics members of the community. We should provide a common platform to these young bloods to come forward and share their experiences. They have so much knowledge, it is unreal. One evening, I spent with a twins brother having abundance of knowledge. Just talking to them gave me so much positive energy. On a funny note, it makes me realise I am getting old very quickly. Deep down, I would like to give back to the community that has been so welcoming. Having said, I have to be selective where I put my energy in. I keep getting invitations to be part of so many exciting things but I hardly find time for it. One thing, I would definitely do before I die is finish the book I started long time ago. It is primarily <strong>Perl</strong> focussed and I have a publisher, <strong>Dave Cross</strong>, ready to help.",
