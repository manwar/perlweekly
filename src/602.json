      "Hi there,",
      "I got the sad news about <strong>Ben Davies</strong> through the git notifications, being member Raku github repositories. Although I didn't know him personally but I felt a personal loss. He was so young and actively involved in development of Raku language. I found <a href=\"https://www.tributearchive.com/obituaries/27062822/benjamin-nelson-davies\">this page</a> sharing the details, if you are interested.",
      "It reminded of loss another very dear friend of mine, <a href=\"https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/03/16/2020-11-farewell-good-friend\">Jeff Goff (aka DrForr)</a>. I had the honour to meet him at various Perl/Raku conferences. Life is so unpredictable, it is unbelievable. I have reached a point in my life where every little things create havoc as far as health is concerned.",
      "Talking about heartbroken news, I would like to bring the subject raised by <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> in the last edition of the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/601.html\">weekly newsletter</a>. At times, I wonder how can one be so disrespectful to others. I was really sad to hear what <strong>Gabor</strong> had to go through. Honestly speaking, I only came to know about <a href=\"https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism\">Antisemitism</a> when I moved to England in 2000. During my college days, I never had interest in subject outside of domain of India. Although I was aware of <strong>love/hate</strong> relationship between Muslims and Jews, I never bothered looking into the history behind it. Muslim community in general in India is more sympathetic towards fellow muslims. Some may find, my relationship with <strong>Gabor</strong> strange. Again, I must confess that I wasn't aware about <strong>Gabor</strong> background when I first met him when he took my interview in <strong>2016</strong>. I only found out later about him being a Jewish when I had further interactions with him with regard to CPAN works. He has been my mentor ever since I first met him and has helped me every time I was in trouble. For me, religion is very personal thing and I like to keep it private. Having said, I don't hide the fact that I am a practicing Muslim.",
      "I urge everyone, please be kind to each other and spread love. Life is too short, so enjoy every moment of it.",
      "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
