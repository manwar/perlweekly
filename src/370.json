       "Last week belonged to The Perl Conference in Glasgow in general. There are many blog sharing the experience appeared in the last few days. I would like to mention one particular blog by a first timer, Sam Anderson. If you haven't read it by now then I would suggest you should read it <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/sam/2018/08/my-first-perl-conference.html\">now</a>.",
       "If you missed the event then don't worry you can still watch the videos available on youtube.",
       "Day 1: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrGSg7uVZj0\">cPanel Theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHN1x7aFQG0\">Pirum Theatre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QYBMNRaFw0\">Zoopla Theatre</a>.",

       "I would also like to remind everyone who attended The Perl Conference in Glasgow to submit the survey without any further delay. Look for email from Barbie in your inbox with the personalised link for the survey. It is important for the organiser to know what went wrong and what went well. At the same time, the speakers get to know if there is any scope for improvement.",
       "Enjoy reading this week newsletter."
