     "Hi there,",
     "Do you remember, the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/706.html\">weekly newsletter</a> where I mentioned about the work carried out for <strong>PPC web portal</strong>?",
     "Well, it is now fully functional and operative: <a href=\"https://perl.github.io/PPCs\">PPC</a>. It has everything that you need to know about the future plan of <strong>Perl</strong>. Not only that, you can also involve in the new feature request. It made the process smooth and easy to understand. You can also take part in the discussion as well. This is your opportunity to share your view on the work being carried out. Or if you have any suggestion, you can use the <a href=\"https://perl.github.io/PPCs/template\">template</a> to submit your ideas. Isn't it simple? The best part for me is the ability to join the discussion in the work being done before it becomes the part of future release.",
     "In the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/709.html\">last edition of newsletter</a>, there was an announcement about <strong>German Perl/Raku Workshop</strong> and <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit</strong>. I encourage every community members to come forward and help the organisers to make it reach wider audiences. There is another announcement about <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/from-code-to-community-sponsoring-tprc-2025\">The North American Perl and Raku Conference</a>. Please do share the details with your colleagues and friends.",
