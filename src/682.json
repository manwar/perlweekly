      "Please tell me how many of you remember the <strong>CPAN Day</strong>?",
      "Honestly speaking, I didn't. It was the <strong>16th August</strong>, just a day after the <strong>Independence Day</strong> celebration for fellow Indians. It was a random post on <strong>Facebook</strong> reminded me of the special occasion. Those who spent good chunk of their life coding in <strong>Perl</strong> would agree with me that we can't think of <strong>Perl</strong> without <strong>CPAN</strong>. They both go hand in hand. I am sure you will find plenty of success story how <strong>CPAN</strong> has helped in getting job done in no time. I still remember the site, <strong>search.cpan.org</strong>, which was the central place for all <strong>CPAN</strong> lookups. Unfortunately it was retired about <strong>6 years</strong> ago, if I remember correctly. Luckily we got really cool replacement i.e. <a href=\"https://metacpan.org\">MetaCPAN</a>. It offers way more features than what we had earlier. Thanks to all the sponsors of <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> and the strong technical team led by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> for the brilliant work.",
      "Many years ago, <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>, wrote an <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/08/cpan-day---start-your-engines.html\">article</a> about <strong>CPAN Day</strong> and suggested tasks we should consider doing to celebrate the occasion. I didn't want to let the special day go without any action. So I decided to upload a new update to <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/BankAccount-Validator-UK\">BankAccount::Validator::UK</a>. I have not been as active as I used to be. I still remember the time when I was hooked to the <strong>CPAN Game</strong>. I remember a post, <a href=\"https://neilb.org/2014/06/27/100-days-of-releases.html\">100 days of CPAN releases</a> by <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> that introduced me to the fun game. There was a time when I used to upload one change a day non-stop for nearly <strong>3 years</strong>. If you fancy more on this then you can checkout this <a href=\"https://neilb.org/cpan-regulars/alltime-top10.html\">page</a> for more fun stats.",
      "As we speak about <strong>CPAN</strong>, how can we miss the <strong>CPAN Testers</strong>? I still remember it was once led by <strong>Barbie</strong> and now it is in the safe hand of <strong>Doug Bell</strong>. Well, last but not least, there is another group worth mentioning here i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang\">Perl Toolchain Gang</a>. Just a few days ago, I was informed about the loss of a very respected member, <strong>Abe Timmerman</strong>, of <strong>Perl Community</strong>. He was actively helping the <strong>Perl Toolchain Gang</strong> setting up <a href=\"https://test-smoke.org\">test-smoke.org</a>. He was mostly known for his work for <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/Test-Smoke\">Test::Smoke</a>. Unfortunately I never met him personally but I still feel the loss. <strong>May his soul rest in peace</strong>, Ameen.",
      "Just a quick reminder to all that in less than <strong>2 months</strong>, the much awaited <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024\">London Perl & Raku Workshop 2024</a> is happening. If you have not registered yet then please do so if you are planning to attend the one day event. This will help the organiser to manage the event better. Also if you are attending the event then why not give a short talk as well. Trust me it is not that difficult. You can talk about your recent encounter with Perl and how you dealt with it. If you or your company would like to sponsor <strong>LPW</strong> then please have a look at the options here: <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html\">https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html</a>.",
