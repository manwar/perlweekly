      "Hi there,",
      "<strong>TPRF</strong> has been associated with the <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org\">Outreachy program</a> for sometime. I have followed the annual program very closely in recent times. I noticed it is helping young fresh bloods getting into open source from <strong>Indian subcontinent</strong>. I know for sure, there are plenty of scope to bring in young students into Perl fold. Unfortunately it is not tapped with focussed program yet. I really want to do something to bring <strong>Perl</strong> back to dicussion table among freshers. I know I have slowdown a bit in recent time because of health issues but I still have the same energy.",
      "For the first time, I have submitted my pet project <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> for the next <strong>Outreachy program</strong>. I am hoping to see some fresh talents coming forward and work with us. Looking forward to mentor and share my experience. I just wish the process was a bit simpler. May be, it is my first time, I find it harder to follow through. My advice to all newcomers stay focussed and work towards your goal taking one step at a time. Don't forget to enjoy the journey while learning. It would make a big difference, trust me.",
