      "Finally I am back to editing the weekly newsletter. Thank you <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> for all the supports and kind words. I would also like to thank all the weekly newsletter readers for sending the sweet message. Never thought it would affect me so much, honestly speaking.",
      "Although I am staying away from screen most of the time, I did see lots of activities by <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. I wish I could help me in his work. If you are interested then you can join and help him on <a href=\"https://osdc.zulipchat.com/\">Zulip</a>.",
      "I have been waiting for the final release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>. However I am very happy to see at least we got the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.38.0-RC2\">RC2</a> out in public.",
      "<strong>Do you know what is in Perl v5.38?</strong>",
      "You can find the details in the <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/blead/perldelta\">perldelta</a> page. For me, <strong>Corinna</strong> is going to be the highlight of the new release. However I am told not to have high expectations about it in this release. Still, I am excited to at least play with it and have fun.",
      "I had almost forgot about participating <a href=\"https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor/\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2023</a> because of what I have gone through in the last few weeks and still going on. But the best part is, I have booked everything from air ticket to hotel reservations. Having said, I still have to get the slides ready for the my talk about <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. If you are planning to attend the conference then please do come and see me. I would love to meet as many Perl enthusiasts as I can. I am mostly looking forward to meet the weekly challenge members. I got exactly <strong>2 weeks</strong> time to get everything sorted before it is too late.",
      "Last but not the least, please do checkout the <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2023/06/05/docker-fix-perl-test-failure\">blog post</a> by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> where he shared his encounter with <strong>Docker</strong> to fix a Perl v5.37 error.",
