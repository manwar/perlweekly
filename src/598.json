      "<strong>Happy New Year everyone !!!</strong>",
      "<strong>Year 2022</strong> saw the biggest release of <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>. It was released with big bang. There were lots of positive vibes around it. I had never seen such noise before. If you missed the fun then you can checkout my <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a>.",
      "I am not a big fan of <strong>TIOBE</strong> but came across <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index\">TIOBE Index for January 2023</a> talking about <strong>Perl</strong> going up slightly in the index recently. It is refreshing to see the progress. Who knows one day, it would reach the <strong>TOP 5</strong> brackets.",
      "Looking back the participation in <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>, it looks promising. Nearly <strong>10K</strong> contributions in <strong>Perl</strong> by the members of <strong>Team PWC</strong> in the last <strong>4 years</strong>.",
      "<strong>What is new happening in Perl?</strong>",
      "For me, personally, I am looking forward to the modern OO <strong>Corinna</strong> in core <strong>Perl</strong>.",
      "<strong>Curtis</strong> wrote an interesting <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/converting-object-oriented-code-to-corinna.html\">blog post</a> recently where he shared his real life experience with <strong>Corinna</strong>.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
