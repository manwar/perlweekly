     "Hi there,",
     "I know we still have <strong>4 months</strong> before the <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> season kicks in but I noticed the ground work has already started by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> with the announcement of <a href=\"https://cfp.perladvent.org\">The Call for Papers for the 2024 Perl Advent Calendar</a>. The <strong>CFP</strong> is open until midnight on <strong>Friday September 30th EST</strong>. I would like to request all <strong>Perl</strong> fans to share their fun encounter with <strong>Perl</strong> as an article for the upcoming <strong>Perl Advent Calendar 2024</strong>. I have already submitted my <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/issues/425\">proposal</a> and keeping my fingers crossed. While talking about, <strong>Advent Calendar</strong>, I would love to see <strong>Dancer2 Advent Calendar</strong> to come back with full force. If I remember correctly, we didn't have the complete calendar last year. Being <strong>Dancer2</strong> fan, I would really want it to get back to its peak. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> is one of those who uses <strong>Dancer2</strong> for building applications. In the <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2024/08/deploying-dancer-apps-addendum\">recent post</a>, he shared his experience about deploying <strong>Dancer Apps</strong>. Even my <a href=\"https://manwar.org\">personal website</a> is a <strong>Dancer2 REST API</strong> application.",
     "It's a bit late to share but better late than never. We have the monthly post about <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-june-2024\">What's new on CPAN - June 2024</a> by <strong>Mathew Korica</strong>. Kudos for the effort and thanks for keeping the tradition alive.",
     "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
