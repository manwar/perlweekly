      "Hi there",
      "Last one week, I have noticed surge in submitting talks/workshops to The Perl Conference in Riga. If you are planning to attend the conferencec then I would recommend <a href=\"https://perlcon.eu/talks/submit\">submit</a> a talk proposal as well. If you are into perl training, like Dave Cross, then why not even submit a workshop. There are already bunch of talks/workshops already submitted as I see listed <a href=\"https://perlcon.eu/talks\">here</a>.",
      "I have also submitted a talk proposal titled <a href=\"https://perlcon.eu/talk/30\">\"CPAN Contributors - Do's and Dont's\"</a>. Dave Cross has written a very nice blog about <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2019/01/plans-for-riga/\">\"Plans for Riga\"</a>.",
      "Last but not the least, Doug Bell, who took over the charge of \"CPAN Testers\" from Barbie, recently compiled a <a href=\"http://preaction.me/mojo/\">webpage</a> listing all his work using the Mojolicious framework.",
      "Have fun reading the newsletter and please don't forget to share with your friends."
