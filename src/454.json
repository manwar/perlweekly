      "Hi there",
      "The Perl Foundation recently announced the closure of long running grant to revitalize blogs.perl.org. I was shocked by the news as I have been waiting for the day when we have new facelift for blogs.perl.org. I know not many people use it but it remains one of the main source of Perl related news. I don't know what is the future of blogs.perl.org. Andre Walker's work in progress is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewalker/PearlBee\">GitHub</a>.",
      "Curtis shared two new pages i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/UNIVERSAL::Cor\">UNIVERSAL::Cor</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Destructors\">Destructors</a>. I am really happy with the progress of Cor, thanks to the trio of Stevan, Sawyer and Curtis.",
      "Last but not the least, look after yourself and your family. Please do share how you are dealing with COVID-19."
