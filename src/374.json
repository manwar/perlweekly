      "As you all know the London Perl Workshop is finally happening on 24th November 2018. If you are going to be in London on the day then I recommend you should visit us. Like every year, this year also we are planning to have collection of great talks and workshops. This year, in particular, we encourage newcomers to come forward and give a short talk (20 min), if not then at least lightning talk (5 min). It doesn't have to about Perl. You could chose any topic you like. Based on my personal exeperience, it will be a life changing experience. If you need any assistane get in touch and we would be more than happy to help you. For senior speakers, please start submiting talk proposals. Here is the <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/newtalk\">link</a> to submit talk.",
