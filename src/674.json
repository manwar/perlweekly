      "Around two weeks ago, <strong>9th June 2024</strong>, the much awaited <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5400delta\">Perl v5.40</a> was released. As always, the production release was packed with cool core enhancements. Thanks to the entire team of volunteers who worked day in day out to get the latest release smoothly. I would like to share my <strong>Top #5</strong> core enhancements as below:",
      "<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/class.pl\">New __CLASS__ keyword</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/class-reader.pl\">:reader attribute for field variables</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/xor.pl\">New ^^ logical xor operator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/try-catch.pl\">try/catch feature no longer experimental</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/for-list.pl\">for iterating over multiple values at a time is no longer experimental</a></li></ul>",
      "Today is the <strong>Day 1</strong> of <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2024 in Las Vegas</a>. The entire day is dedicated for <strong>Hackathon</strong>. The main attraction of <strong>Day 2</strong> is going to be the keynote talk by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> and <strong>Damian Conway</strong>. Who is your favourite <a href=\"https://tprc2024.sched.com/directory/speakers?iframe=no\">speakers</a> at the event? I am looking forward to the talk by work colleague, <a href=\"https://tprc2024.sched.com/speaker/simbabque?iframe=no\">Julien Fiegehenn</a>. There is another speaker I am looking forward to, <a href=\"https://tprc2024.sched.com/speaker/ingydotnet?iframe=no\">Ingy d√∂t Net</a>, who is scheduled to talk about <strong>YAMLScript</strong> and <strong>Clojure</strong>. There is another talk, <a href=\"https://tprc2024.sched.com/event/1dGtK/build-a-better-readme\">Build a better README</a>, is one of my favourites by <strong>Jason Crome</strong>. A recent post, <a href=\"https://yamlscript.org/posts/jun-20-2024\">Dr. StrangeYAML or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the LLM</a> by <strong>Ingy</strong> is not to be missed. If you like playing with <string>LLM</strong> then this is your friend.",
