      "Hi there",
      "With start of December, I see flood of Advent Calendars for the first time ever. It could be I was ignorant before. It is never too late though. I am sure, every Perl hacker would have come across of at least one Advent Calendar i.e. Perl Advent Calendar. For the first time, I came across <a href=\"https://mojolicious.io/\">Mojolicious Advent Calendar</a>. There is one for <a href=\"https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/\">Perl 6</a> as well. There is even one for <a href=\"https://perl6.online/\">Perl 6 one liner</a> Advent Calendar, thanks to Andrew Shitov. I admire all the people behind these Advent Calendar phenomena. It is lot of fun as I tried it myself for the very first time and contributed to <a href=\"http://www.perladvent.org/2018/\">Perl Advent Calendar 2018</a>. It would be a proud moment for me when it does show up one day. I would like to encourage newcomer to come forward and contribute as well to their choice of Advent Calendars. If you missed it this year for any reason then make sure you be prepared well in time next year.",
      "Last week we had London Perl Workshop 2018, if you have attended the event then don't forget to submit the survey. All registered attendees should have received an email from Barbie with link to the survey. Please do share your views about the talks and the events in general. It would help the event organisers to hold the workshop better next time.",
