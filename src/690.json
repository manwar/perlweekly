     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>Happy Hacking everyone !!!</strong>",
     "I hope you are busy contributing during this year <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong>. We are half way through already but still plenty of time left to kickstart if not done already.",
     "<strong>How about LPW 2024?</strong>",
     "Well it is less than <strong>2 weeks</strong> before the much awaited <strong>London Perl & Raku Workshop 2024</strong> begins the fun. I am very happy to see the support of <strong>Perl</strong> community in general. It is great to see regular names in the list of <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html\">sponsors</a>, specially my current employer <strong>Oleeo</strong> as <strong>Gold sponsor</strong>. Thank you, <strong>Lee Johnson</strong>, for all the hardwork, managing the event so smoothly so far. I am confident it would be a memorable event for everyone.",
     "Those who are planning to attend the event, there would be <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7916\">Pre Workshop Social</a> and <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7917\">Post Workshop Social</a>. Please register your details asap. I have once attended pre workshop social in the past as the usual venue is not my favourite spot. Having said, I am planning to break the tradition this year and planning to attend post social workshop. How can I miss the opportunity to meet my techie friends.",
     "<strong>Have you seen the <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/favtalks\">favourite talks</a> list?</strong>",
     "I am personally looking forward to attend the talks e.g. <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904\">Perl in 2030</a>, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907\">Cloudy Perl, how it looks now</a>, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7899\">A modern introduction to XS</a>. Also my own talk, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900\">What's new in Perl v5.40?</a>. I happy to see the some familiar names shown interest in my talk. I can't wait to present my talk.",
     "I am also looking forward to meet some of my techie friends after a long time. Recently I found out one coming all the way from <strong>Canada</strong>. I am wondering if anyone coming from <strong>Japan</strong>. In the past, we always had speaker from <strong>Japan</strong>. I hope to see the familiar face this time too. Anyone from <strong>Germany</strong>? We will all find out first thing at the registration desk on the day.",
     "As the <strong>October</strong> arrived, it also brought the dull weather with it. I don't have good memory about it. I hope it passes without creating any havoc. You take extra care of your health, specially mental and enjoy rest of the newsletter."
