      "Hi there",
      "How do you test <strong>Web API</strong> using Perl?",
      "I am sure you have most likely used TDD to test your Web API. How about trying something new for a change?",
      "Something like BDD, Behaviour Driven Development. I came across BDD many years ago when my manager introduced the term to the team and gave us a short tutorial using Java. I was completely blown away by the idea itself. I never actually got the opportunity to use BDD in any of the Perl projects I have worked afterwards, unfortunately. Then few years later in 2018, I got the opportunity to attend the talk <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/talk/7547\">Behaviour Driven Development and Cucumber</a> by <strong>Martin Berends</strong> at London Perl Workshop. Just quick search and I found the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IsKr50wAE\">video</a> of the same talk. If you missed the talk then it is your chance now to watch the talk. If the video is not enough and you are looking for more. I would highly recommend the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B084Z6GTKK\">Cucumber & Perl</a> by <strong>John Davies</strong>. It was published by <a href=\"https://perlschool.com\">Perl School</a> publishing house run by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>. If you are interested in complete tutorial then you should check out this <a href=\"https://www.cognizantsoftvision.com/blog/how-to-test-web-apis-with-perl-and-cucumber\">blog post</a>.",
      "Talking about BDD, I came across the term \"<strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong>\". TDD has been part of my day job most of the time without realising it being part of XP. I found this <a href=\"https://www.extremeperl.org/bk/home\">website</a> showing <strong>Extreme Programming using Perl</strong>. You can download the entire book in <a href=\"https://www.extremeperl.org/f/extremeperl.pdf\">pdf format</a> for FREE. If you are new to <strong>Extreme Programming</strong> then take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org\">gentle introduction</a>.",
      "Last couple of years have been very tough for most of us in the IT sector. Although we all have been adjusted to the new normal of work from home culture, it still has left some scars behind. Mental health is one such thing being discussed more frequently during this period. I have found a way to keep my mind busy when needed and it is reading books (mostly non-technical). Recently I found the quote <strong>\"Lately my peace has been more important than proving my point.\"</strong> on web that express my current mental state. How do you deal with your WFH blues?",
      "Last but not the least, I have finally reached the 3 digits figure i.e. my <strong>100th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter. It took me nearly <strong>3 years</strong> to get this far. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every readers of the weekly newsletter for the kind words and appreciations. I would also like to thank, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> for being my guide and mentor, all these years.",
      "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter, stay safe and pray for world peace."
