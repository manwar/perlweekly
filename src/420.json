      "Hi there",
      "Last week was occupied with the buzz from The Perl Conference in Riga. It was my second European Perl Conference. If you are regular to such conference then you would certainly know the positive energy that flow during the entire event. However, we all missed, Larry Wall, as he couldn't attend because of health issue. But the organisers came up with sweet idea of sending short message to Larry on the specially designed postcard. We wish Larry get well soon.",
      "I noticed unique voting by the attendees to decide the next venue of The European Perl Conference. I didn't see that in Glasgow last year. There were two choices given between Amsterdam and Cyprus. I voted for Cyprus for one reason as I have never been to Cyprus before. But in the end Amsterdam won the contest by 7 votes.",
      "So, if everything goes as per the plan, I will certainly be going to Amsterdam and meet the local gang from Booking.com.",
      "Last but not the least, there is Swiss Perl Workshop happening August 16-17, 2019 Fl√∂rli Olten, Switzerland. Please do attend if you can.",
      "Enjoy reading this week newsletter."
