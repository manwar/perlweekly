      "Hi there,",
      "<strong>Did you know FOSDEM happened last week?</strong>",
      "<strong>FOSDEM</strong>, Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting, is still a mystery for me. Few years ago a fellow member of LPW organising team introduced me to FOSDEM for the first time. Ever since, I always wanted to attend at least once just to experience the gatherings. I found out familiar faces attending this year FOSDEM like <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>, <strong>Paul Evans</strong> and <strong>Salve J. Nilsen</strong>. Although the location wasn't far from my place but timing wasn't ideal. I wish I was mentally prepared to attend this year FOSDEM. I even saw a <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/vanhoesel/2024/02/fosdem-2024-tprf-community-dinner.html\">post</a> by <strong>Theo van Hoesel</strong> with regard to TPRF sponsored Dinner at FOSDEM. It would have been a great opportunity to meet good old friends. <strong>Paul</strong> shared the live video link from the event. I was able to watch the fun luckily thanks to the organiser. I am hoping the video recordings of the event would be made public soon. Here is the <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/perl_and_raku_programming\">schedule</a> of Perl and Raku Programming devroom.",
      "<strong>Have you tried ChatGPT?</strong>",
      "I have and I find it fun playing with it. Recently I asked \"How do I check if memcached server is running locally and listening to default port?\". Like always, I got instant response with few lines of Perl to get the desired result. Guess what, it didn't do what I asked it to do. I went back and asked again. This time, I got another variation. I tried that too but no luck. By now, I was too tired to repeat the question. I then used CPAN module <strong>IO::Socket::INET</strong> to see if I can create socket. I know it is not ideal but does the job. Time to move on to next thing in the long <strong>TODO</strong> list.",
      "<strong>Does a programmer need to know system admin task also?</strong>",
      "I have been a programmer and only programmer all my life. I remember in the past, I was sent to a week long training to learn sysadmin tasks. It was fresh for a week after the training then I was back to my programmer life. I did enjoy the training and learnt few tricks. As some of you know about my CPAN module, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Map::Tube\">Map::Tube</a>, I published in <strong>2010</strong>. I decided to create <strong>REST API</strong> interface to play with it. Luckily I had another CPAN module, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Map::Tube::Server\">Map::Tube::Server</a>. With this, I was able to setup the server in no time on my local box. Now comes the difficult task, create service to manage the server. Being a programmer doesn't help the cause, also when your box is running <strong>WSL</strong> and not real linux. With the limitation of <strong>WSL</strong>, I had only one option to create service based on <strong>init.d</strong>. It wasn't hard to create service file for the map server. I could even use the service to start the server but termination didn't work for some strange reason. I didn't have the energy to ask <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for help. It has to wait for now.",
      "I am thinking of writing a blog post about the whole process, if I can find spare moment.",
