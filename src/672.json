     "Hi there,",
     "<strong> ... to celebrate the release of Perl v5.40.</strong>",
     "To be honest, I have been watching the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> for the updates almost every day for the last one week. The wait was over finally on Sunday late evening UK time. You can certainly take a <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5400delta\">closer look</a> if you want. I am going to install the latest bundle in the next couple of days and play with it. Having said, I am a bit disappointed to find out that <strong>role</strong> is not yet implemented in the core OO. I understand the workload on the team, specially <strong>Paul Evans</strong>. I wish and hope he gets the support and helping hands in getting the outstanding features done quickly. Reason I am curious about <strong>role</strong> is that I am working on something that uses new OO syntax and I need to implement <strong>role</strong> using it. Unfortunately it has to wait until another big release. Still I am very happy with all other new features. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire team for all the hard work in getting the release done in a timely fashion. You guys are doing a great job. The entire <strong>Perl</strong> community is proud of you all. With all the support around, we will get the glory back very soon.",
     "I am wondering when are we going to have the next edition of <strong>What's new on CPAN?</strong>. I am hoping we would get it by end of this week.",
     "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
