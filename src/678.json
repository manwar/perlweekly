     "Hi there,",
     "The release of latest version of <strong>Perl</strong> kicked the process to elect new <strong>Perl Steering Council</strong>. I am happy to see the return of <strong>Philip Bruhat</strong> and <strong>Graham Knop</strong> to the fold alongwith the new member <strong>Aristotle Pagaltzis</strong>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, <strong>Paul Evans</strong> for the quality contributions. Thanks to the <strong>PSC</strong>, we get regular updates about the work being carried out. If you are interested to know more about it then there is handy website, <a href=\"https://psc.perlhacks.com\">https://psc.perlhacks.com</a>, created by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>.",
     "As you all know we had big release <strong>Perl v5.40</strong> last month and here in one month we have two more relases <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/BOOK/perl-5.41.1/view/pod/perl5410delta.pod\">Perl v5.41.0</a> and <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/ETHER/perl-5.41.2/view/pod/perl5411delta.pod\">Perl v5.41.1</a>. If you checkout the changes in the last two releases, you will find mostly updates to <strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>Pragmata</strong>. For me, the most significant change is the addition of <strong>chdir</strong> as a subroutine to the <strong>CORE::</strong> namespace.",
     "There is another <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/22405\">big change</a> proposed by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> about allowing <strong>can()</strong> to take a list of methods. Having checked the discussion, it seems to have closed without merge unfortunately.",
     "Have you played with <strong>Bitcoin</strong>? Well I haven't yet but will do soon when I find spare time. For now, if you are interested to learn more about it from the <strong>Perl</strong> perlspective, we got 2-part series, <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-02.html\">part one</a> and <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-03.html\">part two</a>, by <strong>Bartosz Jarzyna</strong> shared for <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2023/index.html\">Perl Advent Calendar 2023</a>. Once you have finished reading them we have an <a href=\"https://bbrtj.eu/blog/article/bitcoin-development-update\">update</a> on development of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> libraries.",
     "Do you create quick one-liner in <stromg>Perl</strong>? If yes then please do checkout this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgTnnzaad94\">short video</a>. I started watching but couldn't finish it as I lost the interest halfway through. I have bookmarked it for now, will come back soon. If you are looking for cool one-liners in <strong>Perl</strong> or <strong>Raku</strong> then I would highly recommend the contributions by the <strong>Team PWC</strong> down below under the section <stromg>The Weekly Challenge</stromg>.",
     "Last but not least we have another big release <strong>Dancer2 1.1.1</strong> announced in the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2024/07/dancer2-111-released.html\">blog post</a> by <strong>Jason Crome</strong>. I am very excited about the update and to know that it is being looked after. Thanks to the entire <stromg>Dancer Core Team</strong>. Keep it up great work.",
