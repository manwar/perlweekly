      "Hi there,",
      "Are you a Perl fan? If yes then you are invited to meet <a href=\"https://dev.to/ovid/bringing-modern-oo-to-perl-51ak\">Corinna</a>, thanks to Curtis and his gangs. I have been stalking Corinna ever since Curtis introduced Corinna, previously known as Cor. It is the best thing happened in the recent times, in my humble opinion. I can't wait to see it becoming part of core Perl. But I know for a fact, it is going to be a long wait. I am sure it would be a worthy one. Before I forget I would like to share another <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/7cd0256fe8213953d0f1d86d20d43f4bx\">gist</a> by Curtis where he compared the performance of core, Moose, Moo, and Object::Pad. We are also informed that the :builder is now officially removed from the Corinna MVP. Be prepared, it may come back, but for now, it's dead as <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Corinna-Overview#no-builder-for-the-mvp\">documented here</a>.",
      "Is that the only good news about Perl?",
      "Well, the short answer is No. As we all know, very soon we would have Perl 7 made public. I am little unsure about the launch date. One thing is for sure, Perl 7 is coming first and then Corinna. Please correct me if I am wrong. I am optimistic about Perl future and confident that it is going to bounce back harder.",
