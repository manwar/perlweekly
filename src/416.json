      "Hi there",
      "As you all know the next big Perl event is happening in Riga, Latvia between 7th-9th August 2019. They even put together very entertaining introductory <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co-KcK92Qso\">video</a>. There are going to be 3 keynote speakers this time i.e. Larry Wall (Perl Keynote), Jonathan Worthington (Perl 6 Concurrency) and Elizabeth Mattijsen. I met Larry Wall first time last year during The Perl Conference in Glasgow. As I am attending the event all 3 days, it would be a great opportunity to meet him again and many other great people.",

      "Last but not the least, Congratulation to all English fan for winning the first Cricket World Cup 2019. It was a thrilling and nail biting finish.
