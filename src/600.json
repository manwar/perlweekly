      "Hi there,",
      "Last week, <strong>Team PWC</strong> celebrated the <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-200\">200th week</a> and today we are presenting <strong>600th edition</strong>. Kudos to all the editors, current and past for the care and affections. It feels nice to be associated with such a popular events.",
      "I would also like to thank all the die hard fans of the <strong>Perl Weekly Newsletter</strong> for their support and constructive suggestions from time to time. It really helps me to focus on things important to the readers. I know it is not easy to do this every week but the love and affection we get works like a magic.",
      "I remember there was time when blogging was the only source of information but now a days we have plenty of platforms where you get usefull informations. You know what I mean and where you can catch us. I love having 2-ways dicussion on any topics related to Perl. It is something I always encourage if you have spare time. I have seen how young blood getting involved in so many exciting things about Perl, for example on <strong>Telegram</strong>. Although I don't get time to take part in the discussion but I do watch how the discussion follow through. I have senior member of <strong>Perl Community</strong> helping young blood with their experiences. It would be unfair to name few here. You know who I am talking about. I salute to all those who keep <strong>Perl</strong> alive.",
      "If you have any ideas/suggestions then please do share with us. I would to hear your point of views. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter till then."
