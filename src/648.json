     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>Merry Christmas everyone !!!</strong>",
     "This is my last edition of the year <strong>2023</strong>. Normally it is the time when I look back and recap of my achievements. During my peak, I used to share monthly update and in the end annual report. My last monthly report was <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2021/12/monthly-report---november-3.html\">Nov 2021</a> and last annual report was <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/01/annual-report---2021.html\">Year 2021</a>. Reading back, it sems I had so much time and energy. One thing, however, did stay with me is my pet project, <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>.",
     "<strong>Is there anything to remember year 2023?</strong>",
     "There was one high and one low moment for me. Both happened within weeks of each other. It happened when I was at my lowest for a long time. The low moment was when I lost my dad and couldn't attend the last moments. It wasn't the only low moment in the year 2023. I lost my Mom too yesterday after a long illness. I just want <strong>2023</strong> to get over asap. The high moment was when I received <a href=\"https://whitecamel.org/p/mohammad_sajid_anwar.html\">2022 White Camel Award</a>. Also for the first time, I got the opportunity to attend <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto</strong>. By the way, we have <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/whitecamel2023\">2023 White Camel Award</a> declared now. Heartiest congratulations to <strong>R Geoffrey Avery</strong>, a well deserved member of the community.",
     "<strong>Do I have plans for year 2024?</strong>",
     "I stopped plannings for future as when it doesn't happen then I feel low and it takes time to recover from it. I rather deal each day as it comes. I hope and wish it would bring in fresh evergy.",
     "<strong>Talking about events in 2023 that has bothered me?</strong>",
     "Well, I am not a person who shares his view on social platforms for a reason. I must admit I am not strong enough to deal with responses, positive or negative. This is the reason, I don't share my views with regard to the recent global conflict. Although, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> never hides his view as it is very evident from his post on variious social platforms. I must give credit to him. I remember a sweet moment from the past when I released <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/Calendar-Hebrew\">Calendar::Hebrew</a> on <strong>23rd July 2017</strong>. I wrote a <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2017/07/1000th-consecutive-days-releasing-to-cpan.html\">blog post</a> talking about <strong>1000th consecutive days releasing to CPAN</strong>. I received few comments to my post too. However, there was one from none other than the <strong>Larry Wall</strong> himself as below.",
     "<strong>\"Allow me to also say- and this probably reflects my own limited world experience as much as anything else- how gratifying I find it to see someone named Muhammad release Calendar::Hebrew. Truly you help make this world a better place!\"</strong>",
     "I have known <strong>Gabor</strong> from his contributions to <strong>CPAN</strong>. He has been supporting me on personal and professional front for a long time. He makes me feel so comfortable to talk about anything under the sky. I always go for his guidance everytime I am stuck. I didn't know about <strong>Gabor</strong> link to <strong>Israel</strong> initially. For some it may sound strange relationship between two person with opposing religious background. I don't talk about 2 things in public, one is <strong>Politics</strong> and other is <strong>Religion</strong>. That doesn't mean, I don't have a view. I do but I don't share on public platform. Having said, I do talk about them in private though.",
