      "Hi there",
      "Two weeks ago, I mentioned in the <a href=\"http://perlweekly.com/archive/424.html\">editorial</a> about twin events i.e. Hacktoberfest and London Perl Werkshop. It is nearly a week away before the Hacktoberfest kicks in. Team at <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/\">Perl.com</a> has been preparing for it rigorously. They have even created an <a href=\"https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues/203\">issue #203</a> to discuss the subject. However you could take a look list of <a href=\"https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues\">issues</a> for the ideas for Hacktoberfest challenge.",
      "London Perl Workshop has started process of confirming talks. If you are planning to attend then why not add to your personal schedule your <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2019/talks\">favourite talks</a>. This would help the organisers in scheduling the talks accordingly. If you have never given talk before and would like to give your first talk then please <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2019/newtalk\">submit</a> your proposal as soon as possible. The last date for submitting proposal is 30th September 2019.",
      "Good luck for Hacktoberfest challenge and see you at the next London Perl Workshop 2019 event.",
      "Have a great week ahead."
