      "Hi there",
      "Have you joined the annual <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com\">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> run by Digital Ocean?",
      "If not then you please join without any further delay. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community. You can earn a limited edition T-shirt by completing the challenge.",
      "Not sure if you noticed, this time they have made an interesting change by allowing open source maintainers also to take part in the contest. Ever since I started <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>, I hardly found time to dedicate full time. Last year I could only submit 6 PR, enough to win the contest, since you only need to submit 4 PR. This year, I am only taking part as maintainer of open source project \"The Weekly Challenge\". The best year for me as contributor was year 2019 when I submitted 160 PR.",
      "If you are looking for open source project to contribute then you can join \"The Weekly Challenge\" and win the competition by submitting 4 PRs in just one week.",
      "How?",
      "Well, you could submit 2 Perl and 2 Raku solutions to the weekly task. Just submit one solution per PR. I know it is cheating but a fair one in my humble opinion. Again, please don't limit yourself to just Perl and Raku. You are free to choose your favourite programming language. One more bit, please don't tie yourself to the current weekly challenge. You are free pick any past week challenges. Plenty of choices available. If you have any questions with regard to submit PR then please follow the <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute\">blog post</a> that explains every detail. If you still have any questions then please get in touch with me. You can find my details on the page. I am also accepting PR to the other open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge\">The Weekly Challenge</a> website open source code.",
      "If you are CPAN contributors then you could pick and choose your favourite distribution and contribute. However there is a catch, the distribution may or may not be part of the contest. Having said, you can contribute to my <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/author/MANWAR\">CPAN distributions</a> if you fancy. I promise, I will make the distribution to be part of the contest so that your PR would count towards the target. Just yesterday, I received a <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/BankAccount-Validator-UK/pull/2\">Pull Request</a> to one of my CPAN distribution, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/BankAccount-Validator-UK\">BankAccount::Validator::UK</a>.",
