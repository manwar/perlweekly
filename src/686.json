     "Hi there,",
     "Talking about conference, I would like to share a big announcement about <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/dates_set_tprc_2025\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2025</a>. It was a big surprise for me. I hope and wish this time, it would be a big crowd puller for both <strong>attendees</strong> and <strong>sponsors</strong>. We even have the <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/2024tprc\">action report</a> of <strong>TPRC 2024</strong> as shared by <strong>TPF</strong>. Plenty of interesting results came out of it.",
     "Well, if we are talking conference then how can we miss the long awaiting <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024\">London Perl & Raku Conference 2024</a>. It is going strong as we are approaching the event. A gentle reminder to myself to get my slides ready for my talk. I am super excited to meet my heroes in person.",
     "Last but not least, you please take care of your health. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
