     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>Have you uploaded module to CPAN?</strong>",
     "If yes then you will have come across <strong>PAUSE</strong>. One of the <strong>PAUSE</strong> admins, <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>, has written handful of blog posts to help anyone understand the internals. I would recommend you start with <a href=\"https://neilb.org/2014/03/11/uploading-01.html\">What happens when you upload to CPAN?</a>. I have seen beginners fighting with issues related to versioning. You should checkout one more cool post: <a href=\"https://neilb.org/2013/07/16/version-numbers.html\">Semantic Version</a>. <strong>Do you want more?</strong> If yes there here is one more post on the same subject by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>: <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2016/12/version-numbers\">Version Numbers</a>.",
     "During the research, I found an <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/neil-bowers\">interview</a> of <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> with the chief editor <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. I really enjoyed watching it after a long time.",
     "<strong>How do you debug your Perl script?</strong>",
     "I belong to old school and still today use the command line switch <strong>-d</strong> for debugging. I know there are other ways of debugging. Recently I tried using editor <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> with the help of colleague at work. Although I liked the visual debugging but for me <strong>old is gold</strong>. If you are new to debugging then you should checkout the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtAGbUYTnR0\">YouTube video</a> by <strong>Ricardo Signes</strong>.",
     "<strong>Ever thought of contributing to Perl?</strong>",
     "In old days (15 years for me), it was really complicated subject. Ever since the move to <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5</a>GitHub</a>, it is lot easier to contribute now. The official <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhack\">guide</a> is out there if you fancy. <strong>Paul Evans</strong> written a detailed post: <a href=\"https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2021/02/writing-perl-core-feature.html\">Writing a Perl Core Feature</a>.",
