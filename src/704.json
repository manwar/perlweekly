     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>Do you know of any active Perl Podcast?</strong>",
     "It reminds me when <strong>Lance Wicks</strong> reached out to <strong>Joshua McAdams</strong> to revive <a href=\"http://www.perlcast.com\">Perlcast</a> in <strong>2018</strong>. I later joined hands with <strong>Lance</strong> and we even recorded the first podcast with <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>. Unfortunately it didn't work out. Fast forward, in the new year <strong>2025</strong>, we have another very active member, <strong>Philippe Bruhat</strong>, who came up with <a href=\"https://underbar.cpan.io\">The Underbar</a>, <strong>Podcast for Perl</strong>. There is already <strong>Episode 0 - A New Logo for Perl</strong> is published which was recorded on <strong>January 10th, 2025</strong>. You should listen to it and share your feedbacks to the creator. Also please do spread the word about it.",
     "This year <strong>German Perl/Raku Workshop</strong> is happening in the beautiful city <strong>Munich</strong>. Even if <strong>German</strong> is not your first language, you can still benefit from the presentations. I attended the workshop in the year <strong>2018</strong>, my first time. I enjoyed the 3-days event thoroughly. I even gave couple of presentations in <strong>English</strong>. For me, it was the golden opportunity to meet so many <strong>Perl</strong> stalwarts. I made many friends for life. <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/register\">Buy your tickets now</a>, it is starting on <strong>12th May 2025</strong> and ends on <strong>14th May 2025</strong>.",
     "There is another good news in the year <strong>2025</strong>, <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> has secured sponsor for another 12 months, thanks to <strong>Lance Wicks</strong> for the second year back to back.",
