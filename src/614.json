      "Hi there,",
      "Few days ago, I found this article, <a href=\"https://two-wrongs.com/why-perl\">Why Perl?</a> shared on Facebook. To be honest, there was nothing new in the article, same old bits discussed. Depending on who you ask the question, the chance you might get crispy answer. Well here we have <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/2023/04/29/why-perl\">one</a> by <strong>Flavio Poletti</strong>.",
      "In my career of <strong>over 25</strong> years, I have been part of team building robust application using <strong>Perl</strong> in the nearly every domain under the sun. At my current work place, I got the opportunity to work on a really huge system mostly built using <strong>Perl</strong>. Having said, I do agree that not many people talk about the power of <strong>Perl</strong>. We should all take the collective responsibility and make sure we don't miss a single opportunity to promote <strong>Perl</strong>.",
      "Did you know that <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit 2023</strong> is back?",
      "Altough I am not as active on social platforms as before, I hardly seen any news about it. I just happen to see some activities on <strong>GitHub</strong> by a friend of mine and realised the big event is back after a gap of <strong>4 years</strong>. One of the participant, <strong>Paul Johnson</strong> already shared the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2023/04/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2023.html\">event report</a> if you are interested. I am hoping few more in coming days by other participants.",
      "<strong>Perl</strong> is rarely discussed in the field of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, right?",
      "Now we have a project, <strong>PerlGPT</strong> supported by <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/perlgpt\">The Perl Foundation</a>. We should all promote the project and help in any possible ways.",
      "Similarly there was another big news about latest release of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1344vs5/pdl_2083_released_and_updates_from_a_year_of\">PDL 2.083</a>.",
      "Last but not least, in few weeks time we are going to have a much awaiting release of <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/275f4e511457b9578602fc7a19a23cde36fe66bb/Porting/release_schedule.pod?plain=1#L54\">Perl v5.38</a>. I am confident it would silence the negative voices. Till then enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
