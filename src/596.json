      "Hi there,",
      "With the end of <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> celebration, another celebration kicks in i.e. <strong>Christmas/Boxing Day</strong>. Although I don't celebrate, being a Muslim, but I do enjoy the break from the routine work.",
      "This edition of the weekly newsletter is my <strong>120th edition</strong>. I hope you enjoy reading the newsletter as much as I do getting ready for you.",
      "<strong>Do you have any new year resolutions?</strong>",
      "I used to but then last year I stopped it.",
      "<strong>Why?</strong>",
      "Well couple of projects closed to my heart didn't get started and that made me very pessimistic. I feel so bad that I don't even talk about it. I hope new year will bring positive change.",
      "Still, I don't feel like setting new year resolutions. Could it be, I am getting old to keep up with fast pace dev life? Having said, the dev inside me still alive but just needs some push. Fortunately I have so many people around me that always gives me much needed positive energy.",
      "Let's talk about some positivity now. Well for me, it was the <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022\">Perl Advent Calendar 2022</a>, thanks to <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and team. I wanted to be part of it but then missed the train unfortunately. Never mind, there is always next time. Having said, I did manage to get <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/app-timer\">the post</a> up but was too late to make it. Fortunately my contribution to <strong>Raku Advent Calendar 2022</strong> did work out nicely like <a href=\"https://raku-advent.blog/2022/12/21/day-21-raku-and-i-journey-begin\">Raku and I</a>.",
      "Enjoy rest of the holidays and stay safe."
