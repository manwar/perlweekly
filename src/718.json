     "Hi there,",
     "Please accept my apology for sharing a crypto scam link in the <strong>716th edition</strong> of the newsletter. Thanks to <strong>Gabor</strong> and <strong>Dave</strong>, it was removed straight away. I will be more cautious from now onwards, promise.",
     "Recently, I stumbled upon a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@umeaiman099/top-11-perl-services-companies-in-the-world-in-2025-d939866d25d0\">post</a> titled <strong>\"Top 11 Perl Services Companies in the World in 2025\"</strong>. Sadly, not a single one is based in my city <strong>London</strong>. There was a time, we had plenty! Still, it's not all bad. I was thrilled to see <strong>ActiveState</strong> on the list, the company behind <strong>ActiveState Perl</strong>.",
     "In an <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/716.html\">earlier edition of the newsletter</a>, I mentioned my wish to attend the <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit</strong> which is an <strong>invite-only</strong> annual event. I also shared my interest in contributing to the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> project. To my absolute delight, that wish came true the very same day! I received an invitation from the organiser to join the <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit 2025</strong>, happening in <strong>Leipzig, Germany</strong> from May 1st to May 4th 2025. I didn't wait even a second to accept the invitation. It's truly an honour to be part of such a talented group.",
     "In all the excitement, I've already booked my flight ticket to <strong>Berlin</strong> and from there I'll hop on a fast train to <strong>Leipzig</strong>. The last time, I visited Germany was back in <strong>2018</strong> when I attended the <strong>20th German Perl Workshop</strong> in the city of <strong>Gummersbach</strong>. I even gave couple of talks and one of them being <strong>\"Introduction to Map::Tube\"</strong>. After the event, I even shared my experience in this <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html\">event report</a>.",
     "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
