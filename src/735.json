      "In the recent couple of weeks Mohammad and some others got really excited about the TIOBE index indicating that Perl has got a lot more popular recently. I doubt that. It is way more likely to be a measurement error. I mean they say that Perl jumped from 25th place to the 9th place in one year. Also Ada jumped from the 30th place to the 13th place. Who is writing in Ada and what?",
      "Anyway, let's assume there is interest in Perl. Wouldn't it be a good idea to convert that to meetings and presentations? I went overt the list of <a href=\"https://www.pm.org/\">Perl Monger groups</a>. I recall seeing more than 200 groups in that list. Now there are only 22 groups and most of those don't seem to have any activity. The events I found I added to our <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/events\">events page</a>. Their events should show up in our calendar. I also reached out to some of them asking them to update our calendar (which is generated from a JSON file on GitHub) and I also asked some if they would be interested organizing online events.",
      "Online events: I don't have any Perl-related business any more (that is, no training requests and no contract work, not even for moving away from Perl), but I have a <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab\">few books</a> and giving presentations related to those topics help me update the books. So maybe we can organize a few of those. I also hope that some other people will be interested in giving online presentations. Nothing fancy. Think about 'explaining this stuff to my co-worker' level of presentation.",
