               "text" : "Major change in 3.006 is a vast overhaul of most of the code to eliminate depending on wxWidgets 2.8 and 3.0 compatibility hacks. The code is much cleaner now, and builds without problems with 3.2, 3.3.0 and 3.3.1 (at this time latest wxWidgets release).<p> This makes wxPerl better prepared for the future! Future releases of wxWidgets should no longer impose substantial porting problems.<p>When building wxPerl, all tests should succeed. If you are missing features please issue a request on the issue tracker. <p> A good showcase is Wx::Demo, also available on GitHub.  For best results, remove all installed Alien::wxWidgets packages and install the latest from GitHub.",

I have some presentations I could give and I am sure others could offer theirs. These presentation don't need to be the well-prepared and well-rehearsed ones you would give at a conference, it could be more akin to sharing your knowledge with some co-worker over a virtual tea. Contact me if you'd like to give it a try!",
