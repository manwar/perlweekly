         "The newly formed \"Perl Steering Committee\" has put together a detailed explanation on proposed state of <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/828384/\">Perl 7</a>. It is a rather long email from Ricardo Signes but worth reading every line of it. Kudos to Ricardo for putting together such a detailed explanation.",
         "TPF Marketing committee came up with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGwTCV8TIELW1tYkYv2Sl-z7uSCthXB0XfN2TGTrQftCz2Kw/viewform\">survey</a> to help with marketing strategies and branding. I would request the Perl and Raku community members to share their views with the TPF Marketing committee.",
         "In the last <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/471.html\">edition</a> of the weekly newsletter, Gabor mentioned about our Patreon profile.

Gabor thanked the supporters in the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2020/08/supporting-perl-related-creators-via-patreon.html\">blog</a>. I followed the footsteps of Gabor, wrote <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2020/08/thank-you-for-the-support.html\">thank you blog</a>.",
