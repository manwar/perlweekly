     "<string>Is it TPF or TPRF?</strong>",
     "Looking at the official <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org\">news page</a>, it still says <strong>The Perl Foundation News</strong>. I have no issue how you call it whether <strong>TPF</strong> or <strong>TPRF</strong>. The most important bit is the work they do to promote <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> programming languages. There was a big news recently as we had the <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/presidentslettert2024\">Letter from the President</a>. We don't very often hear from the President. I was curious to find out what is special this time.",
     "I would like to talk about two things, one the <strong>2024 Prospectus</strong> and second about new board members. Honestly, I never knew about the prospectus. I will be watching when it gets published more likely ahead of the annual conference in <strong>Las Vegas</strong> in the month of <strong>June 2024</strong>. With regard to the new members, <strong>Bruce Gray</strong> and <strong>Ruth Holloway</strong>, I would like to congratulate both of them. I am confident they are going to be a big help to present the wider audience point of views. It is a proud moment for me as <strong>Bruce Gray</strong> is one of the most active and regular members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>.",
     "<strong>OK, tell me how many of you watched the live release of Perl v5.39.7?</strong>",
     "To be honest with you, I wasn't aware of such live streaming of Perl release. Thanks to <strong>Gabor</strong> for this information in the last edition of the newsletter. For me, it was perfect timing, first thing on Saturday morning. I was a mute spectator, just watching the release flow. Some of the things just went above my head but few things I could follow. It was fun though. I would definitely watch the live streaming if it happens again. Just out of curiosity, I asked one question in the end about release ETA of <strong>Perl v5.40</strong>. I got the response that in the next <strong>2-3 months</strong>. That made me really happy as I am eagerly waiting for the next big release. Looking forward to more features to the newly added OO ecosystem.",
     "<strong>Do you use GitHub Actions?</strong>",
     "I was fortunate to attend the talk on the subject by <strong>Dave Cross</strong> at the Perl Conference in Toronto last summer. It is really cool thing to have if you have codebase in <strong>GitHub</strong>. I would highly recommend you checkout his <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2024/01/github-actions-for-perl-development\">latest post</a> where he shared the details.",
     "<strong>Are you enjoying the cold days and nights of January?</strong>",
     "Personally, I just hate it as my body doesn't like extreme condition either cold or hot. I know I came from a place in India where <strong>50 degree celcius</strong> was normal during summer. Not anymore unfortunately, may be I am getting old now. I just want <strong>January</strong> to get over asap as in this month we hardly get any sun where I live.",
     "Have a safe and fun week ahead."
