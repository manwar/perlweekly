      "We used to get regular update earlier and I really enjoyed the discussion about the Corinna. Last week <strong>Curtis</strong> shared a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OvidPerl/status/1590247361384792065\">tweet<a> where he mentioned that code example has been added to <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/README.md\">README.md</a>. I am sure you are going to love it. Thank you <strong>Curtis</strong> and the entire team of <strong>Corinna</strong> for all the hard work. We are waiting for it patiently.",
      "There was one more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OvidPerl/status/1591119906510077963\">tweet</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> that made my day about the proposed feature of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong> where you no longer need to end module with true value. In my career of <strong>23 years</strong>, I have come across many creative ways to return true values in the module. I welcome this change and thanks the entire team.",
