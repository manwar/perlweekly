      "London Perl Workshop is making good progress thanks to the hard work of <strong>Lee Johnson</strong>. As per the <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024\">official website</a>, we now have a <strong>Diamond Sponsor</strong>. I am hoping venue would be finalised soon. I would urge all <strong>Perl</strong> fans to register your interest in the event so that the organiser can plan the event better.",
      "The upconing event, <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas</strong>, is in demand. I get to hear a lot of preparation is underway to make it memorable experience for all attendees. I am going to miss the fun, unfortunately. I hope to join you all online if it is available.",
      "Last but not least, you take extra care of yourself and your loved ones. Enjoy and celebrate Perl as always."
