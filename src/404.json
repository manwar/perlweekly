      "Hi there",
      "Recently the White Camel Awards 2018 were annouced and awarded to three very popular names. In category \"Perl Community\", Todd Rinaldo was choosen for his help to organize Perl conferences and hackathons and provided other support through one of Perl's largest financial contributors, cPanel. For \"Perl Advocacy\", David Farrell was the winner for PerlTricks and Perl.com. Last but not the least, in the category \"Perl User Groups\", Max Maischein was picked as winner. Max Maischein has been Frakfurt.pm's treasurer since 2011, handling the accounting, reporting, and contracting, as well as coordinating work with other local organizations. Without that important work nothing could get done. He's part of the backbone of the German Perl community.",
      "Congratulations to all three winners from the team of PerlWeekly newsletter.",
      "Have a great week ahead and enjoy the sun."
