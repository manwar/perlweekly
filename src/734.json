     "Hi there,",
     "Last week, <strong>16th August</strong>, we all celebrated the <strong>CPAN Day</strong>. It's a good time to step back and appreciate how resilient <strong>Perl</strong> has been in the pantheon of programming languages. The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (<strong>CPAN</strong>) has anchored developer productivity for many decades with thousands of modules designed to elegantly and effortlessly solve problems, both great and small. <strong>CPAN Day</strong> doesn't just celebrate code, it celebrates the collaborative, creative nature of the open source environment fueled by a community that supports <strong>Perl</strong>'s continued viability.",
     "<strong>Perl</strong>'s accomplishments don't begin and end with the <strong>CPAN</strong> archives. Recent changes marked in the <strong>TIOBE Programming Language Index</strong> signify something exciting. <strong>Perl</strong> is rising up the list. <strong>Perl</strong> is seeing new interest and activity metrics that make it clear: <strong>Perl</strong> is here to remind the technology space that flexibility, text-processing capabilities and the advantages of a mature ecosystem have immense value in <strong>2025</strong> and beyond.",
     "So why after so long are we seeing an uptick in interest?",
     "It may be that developers are recognising a growing need for tools for rapid prototyping, de-risked data manipulation and safe systems scripting. These areas are what <strong>Perl</strong> continues excel at. Furthermore, with best practices for modern <strong>Perl</strong> in place and the support of a continuously active community, <strong>Perl</strong> is likely showing people it's not a has-been but a different kind of choice for different kinds of problems.",
     "This <strong>CPAN Day</strong>, spend some time exploring a new module, contributing to an existing module or just enjoying the invention of other people which is on <strong>CPAN</strong>. I released patch to a long-standing encoding issue in <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/Data-Money\">Data::Money</a> to celebrate the day.",
     "Please share how you celebrated the special day. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
