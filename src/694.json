     "Hi there,",
     "It has been two weeks since the <strong>London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024</strong>, and we are still receiving attendee reports. Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their experiences. Last week, I came across two such reports by <a href=\"https://leejo.github.io/2024/11/07/smashed_tvs\">Lee Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2024/11/08/how-i-spent-my-first-london-perl-workshop\">Olaf Alders</a>. I'm still hoping to find a moment to reflect on my own workshop experience.",
     "<strong>LPW</strong> holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first workshop where I gave my first talk ever. I was introduced to <strong>LPW</strong> by a colleague at work. Back then, there was always an <strong>O'Reilly</strong> stall outside the theater room, selling <strong>Perl</strong> books and surrounded by a large crowd. I remember the days when we had three strong tracks running simultaneously and, especially, the last <strong>LPW</strong> organized by <strong>Mark Keating</strong> and his team. The transition was seamless, and we continued the workshop smoothly until <strong>COVID-19</strong> struck. For a brief period, I was part of the organizing team, but my contributions were limited to promoting the event and assisting attendees on the day.",
     "Bringing the workshop back after <strong>COVID-19</strong> was the brainchild of <strong>Lee Johnson</strong> and <strong>Julien Fiegenhenn</strong>. Their hard work truly paid off, as the event was well-attended and praised for its smooth execution. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organizing team for providing a platform to reconnect with friends from around the world. The future of LPW looks bright as I’m hearing a lot of positive feedback about next year’s workshop, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",
