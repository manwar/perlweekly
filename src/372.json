      "Hi there",
      "During The Perl Conference in Glasgow last month, Lance Wicks shared the idea of reviving Perl Podcast. I liked the idea and we decided to work on it together. Gabor started something similar few years ago, <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/cmos\">CMOS</a>. Unfortunately not much activity seen recently. Ideally we would like focus on pure Perl (perl5 and perl6) initially. We have reached out to Joshua McAdams, creator of <a href=\"http://www.perlcast.com/\">Perlcast</a> for assistance.",
      "Past one week has been really busy with Perl workshops, not just one but two i.e. <a href=\"https://oslo.pm/npw2018/\">Nordic Perl Workshop and Mojoconf</a> and <a href=\"http://act.perl-workshop.ch/spw2018/\">Swiss Perl Workshop</a>. Unfortunately the dates clashed, making it difficult for the Perl Hackers to decide which one to go.",
      "Talking about perl workshop, next in line is <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/\">London Perl Workshop</a> which is happening on 24th November 2018. They are accepting <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/newtalk\">talk/worshop proposals</a> now. We would love to see more first time speakers giving short (20 min) talk or even lightning (5 min) talk."
