<title>#733 - Perl using AI</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/733.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;AS you know I teach Python and Rust (and I would teach Perl as well if clients were asking for it), and recently I started to wonder how to change my material and my assignment to have any value in the age of AI.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I tried several of the assignments I usually give to my students, pasted them in copilot and got a working solution with tests and documentation. The solutions were good, and way &#x27;better&#x27; than what I teach. Better in that they already included input validation, exception, written with separation of concerns. Most of these things are relatively advanced. Well, at least you usually don&#x27;t learn about them in the first few hours of learning.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The students can also ask the AI to explain each word and each symbol in the code. The question remains of course, if they will understand the language the AI uses or if they need a simpler explanation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case it seems these assignments are now rather useless as the students - especially the ones that are only interested in the credit - will use AI to generate the solution and won&#x27;t learn a thing. Besides copy-pasting the assignment and the solution.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you have ideas of how and what should I teach to help them become productive, let me know in an email!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#732 - MetaCPAN Success Story</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/732.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x27;s recent battle against mounting traffic abuse stands as a powerful testament to the resilience and ingenuity of open&#x2011;source infrastructure teams. After enduring recurring &#x3C;strong&#x3E;503&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; outages that jeopardized service for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; hackers worldwide, the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; team embarked on a disciplined, data&#x2011;driven counterattack. What began with rudimentary &#x3C;strong&#x3E;logs&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;robots.txt&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; tweaks and manual &#x3C;strong&#x3E;IP&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; bans evolved into a robust partnership with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.datadoghq.com&#x22;&#x3E;Datadog&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.fastly.com&#x22;&#x3E;Fastly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, enabling real&#x2011;time visibility and proactive defense. With the deployment of sophisticated &#x3C;strong&#x3E;rate&#x2011;limiting&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; rules, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;user&#x2011;agent&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; filtering, next&#x2011;generation &#x3C;strong&#x3E;WAF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; protections and a dynamic challenge system, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has successfully blocked some &#x3C;strong&#x3E;80&#x202F;percent&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of malicious traffic&#x2014;including &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; scrapers&#x2014;while delivering a steady, reliable experience to legitimate users. This journey highlights how transparency, layered defense and smart automation can transform a crisis into an opportunity for stronger, more sustainable service.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Gardner&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x2019;s return to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://phoenixtrap.com&#x22;&#x3E;technical blogging&#x3C;/a&#x3E; marks a welcome revival of one of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x2019;s clearest and most thoughtful voices.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; created a mobile app, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Heaven Vs Hell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, written using react native and backend API&#x27;s in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mojolicious&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can find it in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heavenvshell&#x22;&#x3E;Google Play&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heaven-vs-hell/id6748543465&#x22;&#x3E;App Store&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#731 - Looking for a Perl event organizer</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/731.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pm.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; once had hundreds of active groups. Now there are only 22 listed and even them are probably not very active.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are number of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/topics/perl/&#x22;&#x3E;groups on Meetup mentioning Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, however in reality many of those don&#x27;t actually have Perl-related content or an inactive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the Perl Weekly site we have a number of groups listed and a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;calendar of events&#x3C;/a&#x3E; based on the &#x3C;b&#x3E;event.json&#x3C;/b&#x3E; file in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly&#x22;&#x3E;our repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I wish more organizers used this calendar and the Perl Weekly to reach new audiences.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So here is an idea. We need someone who has time, energy, and interest organizing &#x3C;b&#x3E;online Perl events&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. Each even could contain a presentation and then some free chat. The event(s) could be organized under various of these groups at times convenient for the local audience and the speaker.  I have some presentations I could give and I am sure others could offer theirs. These presentation don&#x27;t need to be the well-prepared and well-rehearsed ones you would give at a conference, it could be more akin to sharing your knowledge with some co-worker over a virtual tea. Contact me if you&#x27;d like to give it a try!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#730 - RIP MST</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/730.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We all know the loss of brilliant mind, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Matt S Trout&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am still recovering from it. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;RIP&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, my friend.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Every time I come across this: &#x3C;strong&#x3E;*1983 - 2025*&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it reminds me of my birth year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;*1975*&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; seems to be running smoothly as shared in this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2025/07/metacpan-running-really-well-thanks.html&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dean&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Anyone interested in the work done can find the documentation &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-k8s/issues/154&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; videos are now public on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Of all of them, one of my favourites is the talk about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTj-lT2Y40&#x22;&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Jason Crome&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you know, we had the development release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.42.0-RC1&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;June 25, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In case you missed it, here is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/CONTRA/perl-5.42.0-RC1/view/pod/perldelta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;delta page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; listing all the changes in the release. A week later, we had the maintenance release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.42.0&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;July 3, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Again, we have a dedicated &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/BOOK/perl-5.42.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;delta page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for this release.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;What&#x27;s your favourite change in this release?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I liked the support for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;lexical method&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the experimental class feature. I&#x27;m aware, there are many other importants improvements and bug fixes as well. A big &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thank You&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Development Team&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;What&#x27;s next in the pipeline?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, if you ask me, I&#x27;m still waiting for support for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;roles&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the experimental class feature. I&#x27;ve heard some whispers that it&#x27;s in the pipeline. I&#x27;m glad it has not been pushed aside. I&#x27;m hoping the next stable release will bring good news, fingers crossed!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;What are you working on these days?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;m mostly working on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; related services these days as my day job revolves around them. I&#x27;m super excited to be working under the guidance of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Andrew Solomon&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://geekuni.com&#x22;&#x3E;GeekUni&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Whenever I explore something new, I create a public post about my experience, viewing it through the lens of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x27;s not always about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, my last post was about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/lexical-method-v542&#x22;&#x3E;Lexical Method in Perl v5.42&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I know, it&#x27;s been nearly a month now but I&#x27;m currently working on a blog post about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS Lambda&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. My experience so far has been a bit mixed. The native support for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS Lambda&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not as robust as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x27;s. After spending a few nights on it, I finally gave up. I&#x27;m happy creating lambda function in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and then calling them programatically from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The most fun part is when the lambda function is stored in an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;S3 bucket&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Then there&#x27;s another twist, using &#x3C;strong&#x3E;APIGateway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to call lambda function. I use &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LocalStack (the free version)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as a local platform. Unfortunately, the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;free&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; version doesn&#x27;t have all the features enabled, but it&#x27;s still good enough to get my hand dirty.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My go-to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; module for all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; related services is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws&#x22;&#x3E;Paws&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I must admit, it&#x27;s been rock solid.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Apart from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I&#x27;m also working on blog posts about &#x3C;/strong&#x3E;DBIC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ElasticSearch&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Caching&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Serialisation&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Some are nearly finished, they just need a final touch-up before going public. You can track all my experiments on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs&#x22;&#x3E;personal blog page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed a nee section titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Sponsors&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; added to the newsletter by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It did the trick for me and brought in one additional sponsor last week, taking the total count to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;35 sponsors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I&#x27;d like to take this opportunity to thank each and every sponsor for their generous support. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the initiative!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and take extra care of yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2025-gsp/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was held 2 weeks ago, videos are being uploaded to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sad news: Mark Keating posted that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.shadowcat.co.uk/2025/07/09/ripples-they-cause-in-the-world/&#x22;&#x3E;Matt S. Trout (mst) passed away&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Mark also collected the comments and publications of others.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#728 - Perl Conference</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/728.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week was packed with two major gatherings for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; enthusiasts: &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Community Conference (Hybrid) Summer 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Both events brought together developers, contributors and fans from around the world, whether in person or online.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t attend either conference this time but I&#x27;m eager to catch up on what I missed. If you were there, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experience. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Makoto Nozaki&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has already shared one: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2025/07/tprc-greenville-2025.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thank you for that. If others have insights, talks or highlights to share, please do.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For those curious about the talks, the official &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PCC 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; schedule is available &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlcommunity.org&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I spotted a live talk link on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and joined briefly, but due to audio issues, I had to drop out. Fingers crossed that recordings or slides will be shared soon for those of us who couldn&#x27;t attend fully.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One thing, I noticed this year, there wasn&#x27;t much pre-event promotion for individual talks or maybe I just missed it on social media? Either way, if you couldn&#x27;t make it, keep an eye out for uploaded slides and summaries. There&#x27;s always something new to learn!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x27;s all for now, enjoy the rest of the newsletter and happy coding..&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#727 - Which versions of Perl do you use?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/727.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently I ran a poll asking &#x3C;b&#x3E;Which versions of Perl do you use at work?&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. I asked it both &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/posts/1967801127360837/&#x22;&#x3E;in the The Perl Community group on Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://t.me/PerlMaven&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Maven community Telegram Channel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://t.me/perlp&#x22;&#x3E;Perl 5 Telegram channel&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There were 75 votes in the Facebook group: 1% use 5.42; 17% use 5.40; 30% use 5.38; 5% use 5.36; 29% use 5.22-5.34; 13% use 5.12-5.20; 5% use 5.10 or older.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There were 29 votes in the Telegram group(s): 14% use 5.42; 31% use 5.40; 34% use 5.38; 7% use 5.36; 38% use 5.22-5.34; 17% use 5.12-5.20; 7% use 5.10 or older. Yes, people could select multiple answers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You can still go an vote in either of those polls.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Many people commented that they use the version of perl that comes with the OS, to which Dave Cross posed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/stop-using-your-system-perl/&#x22;&#x3E;Stop using your system Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I don&#x27;t fully agree, but he has a point.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x27;t recall what exactly prompted me to do this, but a few days ago I started to write a book about OOP - Object Oriented Perl. I took some of the slides I had for my advanced Perl course, started to update them and started to write explanations around the examples. As I write them I post the articles in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community group on Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;my LinkedIn page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you use Facebook I&#x27;d recommend you join that group and if you use LinkedIn I&#x27;d recommend you follow me. If you would like to go further and connect with me on LinkedIn, please include a message saying that you are a reader of the Perl Weekly newsletter so I&#x27;ll have some background.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Besides publishing them on the social sites I also collect the writings about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://slides.code-maven.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl OOP&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on my web site and I also started to publish the book on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Leanpub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I am sure you know editing the Perl weekly, writing these examples and articles and the book takes a lot of time that I should spend earning money by helping my clients with their Perl code-base. Luckily there are some people who support me financially via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. (Hint: it would be awesome if you&#x27;d also sponsor me with $10/month.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are many people who like to get something &#x27;tangible&#x27; to really justify their support. If you are such a person I created the Leanpub book especially for you. You can buy the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl OOP book&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and some of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;my other books&#x3C;/a&#x3E; getting a &#x3C;b&#x3E;pdf&#x3C;/b&#x3E; and an &#x3C;b&#x3E;epub&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (for Kindle) version. You will both support my work and get an e-book. You will also get all the new versions of the book as I update it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#726 - Perl and ChatGPT</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/726.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Most of us have explored and seen the power of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ChatGPT&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Last week, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared very interesting tool written in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to create podcast for the Perl Weekly newsletter. We already have podcast for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-723.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #723&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-724.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #724&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-725.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #725&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am very impressed with the content and sound quality. Great job, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can checkout the code in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Another post, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/a-slice-of-perl&#x22;&#x3E;Slice of Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; inspired me to write about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/array-vs-list&#x22;&#x3E;Array vs List&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fan, we have a good news, very soon there would be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2025/06/upcoming-dancer2-200-release.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dancer2 2.0.0&#x3C;/a&#x3E; release. I am very excited and looking forward to it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#725 - Perl podcasts?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/725.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First of all, I&#x27;d like to apologize, I could not get back to every reader of the Perl Weekly who expressed their solidarity and asked if I am in any danger: Thank you for asking! My immediate family and myself, are OK, but it is scary to be targetted by half-a-ton ballistic missiles.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A funny thing happened, someone, called SophoDave, asked if there are any &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1lah0a7/perl_podcasts/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl podcasts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; just when the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/2/&#x22;&#x3E;2nd episode of The Underbar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was published. One person recommended our newsletter to which Olaf Alders suggested someone could read it out aloud.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dave Cross wrote about a Perl script &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/generating-content-with-chatgpt/&#x22;&#x3E;Generating Content with ChatGPT&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Which made me wonder, would it be possible to have some Perl script that would take the content of the Perl Weekly newsletter and using some AI tool would generated a podcast out of it? Any volunteers?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish you a calm week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#724 - Perl and XS</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/724.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What&#x27;s &#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS (eXternal Subroutine)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is a glue language that helps &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; interact with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;C&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sounds simple?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In my personal experience, it&#x27;s not simple at all. I&#x27;ve tried many times but never managed to fully grasp it. Recently, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, shared a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-xs-how-to-create-an-object-24lj&#x22;&#x3E;blog post series&#x3C;/a&#x3E; titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Learning XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which I found very helpful in unraveling its complexity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; also wrote another blog series for newcomers: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-introduction-3d1a&#x22;&#x3E;Learning Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m sure this would be handy for anyone looking to explore &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lately, I&#x27;ve been playing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS S3&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and have shared my experiences in two posts so far:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/localstack-aws-s3&#x22;&#x3E;LocalStack with AWS S3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/aws-s3-encryption&#x22;&#x3E;AWS S3 Encryption&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are plenty more articles in the pipeline, so watch this space!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
