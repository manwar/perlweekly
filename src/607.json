It is an excellent way to follow what's going on in and around Perl on a daily basis. Now also including commits to the source code of Perl and questions on Stack overflow. I've also opened two issues asking Dave to allow the user to filter the messages based on source and to color-code the sources. Something one of you could implement in the front-end.",

The rant was on why Perl is dying. Basically Ovid says that Perl lags behind the more popular languages adopting new features. Including features that were available to some other languages 10-20-40 years ago. Predictably some people jumped on blaming the Perl 6 effort. Others pointed out the lack of volunteers. The lack of outreach. The missing modules from the standard libraries.",

I posted the link to the Perl programmers group on Facebook. They did not like the numbers.",

However, it's <a href=\"https://github.com/dependabot/\">source code is on GitHub</a> so interested parties could probaly add this support. Let me know when it becomes available so I can try it.",
