       "Belated happy birthday to my favourite language, <strong>Perl</strong>, on completing 34 years. <strong>Mark Gardner</strong> used his weekly blogging schedule to celebrate the occassion in his <a href=\"https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/12/21/34-at-34-for-v5-34-modern-perl-features-for-perls-birthday\">blog</a>.",
      "Do you remember which year you first picked the <strong>Perl</strong> language?",
      "For me, I was introduced to <strong>Perl</strong> in the year 1998. So technically, I am 23 Perl years old. How about you? I am wondering if anyone other than the creator, picked the language in the first year itself. If you know the name then please do share with us. I am sure there must be handfull that I am not aware of.",
      "Talking about birthday celebration, I would like to wish belated Happy Birthday to the mother of chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. As per the record, my birthday was last Monday i.e. <strong>20th December</strong>. Till date, I never celebrated my birthday, this year also went without celebration.",
       "I noticed that I am getting close to my <strong>100th edition</strong> of the newsletter. This is my <strong>94th edition</strong>. It would be a big achievement for me, personally, to reach the number. I am looking forward to the <strong>556th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter as that would be my <strong>100th edition</strong>.",
      "Stay safe and enjoy the holiday break."
