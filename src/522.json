      "Hi there",
      "I am sure many of you are aware of <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org\">Outreachy</a>. It all started with GNOME's Women's Summer Outreach Program (WSOP) in 2006. The idea was to encourage women participation in Open Source projects. In 2009, GNOME community revived the program to encourage more women to contribute to GNOME and renamed it to GNOME Outreach Program for Women. It became very popular program in no time and did bring in more women into the fold. The program was further expanded with more organizations joining the hand e.g. Fedora, Mozilla, JBoss, OpenStack, Subversion etc. With the additions, in 2013, the program was renamed to Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program. At one point, there were 16 organizations involved in this program. In 2015, the program was again renamed to Outreachy.",
      "Did I mention Perl in the above discussion?",
      "Well, in 2014, TPF sponsored Internship to Pattawan Kaewduangdee to work on MetaCPAN under the leadership of Olaf Alders as a part of Outreach Program for Women. There is another name that caught my eyes, Upasana Shukla. I came across <a href=\"https://upasana.me/2013/05/18/meta-cpan-debian-wikimedia-twisted-dancer-moose/\">blog post</a> by Upasana where she mentioned how GNOME's Outreach Program for Women helped her got into Perl fold. If you look at the <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2021-05/\">list of interns</a> from Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka) is amazing. In the recent years, TPF sponsored <a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org\">Open Food Facts</a> projects for Outreachy. In 2020, Areesha Tariq, from Pakistan successfully got the internship to work on Open Food Facts project. Please checkout the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@areeshatariq02/get-a-remote-and-paid-internship-my-outreachy-experience-482a6cfc0564\">blog post</a> by Areesha sharing her experience. It didn't stop there, few weeks ago, TPF announced another intern, Rosheen Naeem, again from Pakistan to work on Open Food Facts project. You should checkout her recent <a href=\"https://roshnaeem.medium.com/everybody-struggles-f6dbe33293b4\">blog post</a> about her journey. It is very inspiring.",
      "I would like to thank TPF for supporting the Perl projects and Outreachy.",
      "I can tell you from my own experience, we have great talent in the Indian Subcontinent. I wish more and more organisations come forward and sponsor Interns from these regions. When I started <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge - Perl & Raku</a>, (a.k.a Perl Weekly Challenge), I was hoping to tap in the talent pool from the region, specially young college students. As the tag line says \"You do not have to be an expert\" to take part in the weekly challenge. Although we do have handful students from Russia in the team. I am glad at least we have built a platform where Geeks from around the world come and share their experiences every week. May be one day when we have sponsors to help us reach out to young talent and bring in new energy to the Perl community. Sometimes I wonder why we never had Perl Conference in Indian subcontinent just like we have here in Europe and America. It shouldn't be too hard to hold one as these days everything is online. We could invite guest speakers from across the globe to adress the talent in the region. Is there anyone out there willing to help us orgranise Perl Conference?",
