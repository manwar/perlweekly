      "It seems we have been spoiled with the in-person conference. For all the <strong>Perl</strong> fans, we got two choices, <a href=\"https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor\">The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto</a> and <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi\">The Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki</a>. I would highly recommend the one convenient to you. We all need to come together and share the knowledge.",
      "I am all set for the one in <strong>Toronto</strong>. Thanks to the organiser, I got the time slot to give a talk on <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. Looking at the list of attendees and speakers, it is going to be fun 3 days event. Looking forward to meet fellow <strong>Team PWC</strong> members at the event.",
      "Few weeks ago, I spoke about the ambitious project, <strong>The Perl Conference in India</strong>. Soon I realised, it isn't the right time to talk about. Although not my idea originally, I am taking a back seat for now. I hope to see it happening in my life time.",
