      "Hi there",
      "Start of last week was terrible for all Perl fans. We came to know that Sawyer decided to step down from Perl Steering Council and all other affiliates. At the time, when Perl is making comeback so nicely, this came as a shocker. We need him more now to be actively involved and take us to a new heights. Having said, I do respect his decision and wish him all the best. I hope to meet him once again personally at some Perl conference.",
      "We shouldn't loose hope, though. Neil Bowers came up with <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/pdl/mailman/message/37263352\">detailed plan</a> that gave me confidence that we will bounce back.",
      "I have seen Sawyer regularly at London Perl Workshops but never got to speak to him. Then came a big moment of my life, I was giving the talk <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7209\">Create tube map in 20 minutes using Map::Tube</a> at London Perl Workshops 2017. Sawyer was the man behind the camera recording the talk. At the end of the talk, Sawyer came up to me and suggested how I can automate some of the tasks I mentioned in the talk. It was a big fan moment for me. Everything is still so fresh in my mind.",
      "Apology for the delay as it is first edition for me in the month of Ramadan. I wish all the readers a very happy Ramadan. May ALLAH s.w.t. protect us all from the evils. Ameen."
