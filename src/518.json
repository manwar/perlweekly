     "Hi there",
     "I recently came across a <a href=\"https://davecross.substack.com/p/the-story-of-ebooks-and-me\">blog post</a> by Dave Cross where he shared his story how he got into publishing ebook. I highly recommend you read his blog, I find it inspirational, personally. I always wanted to write technical book on the subject related to Perl. I have high regards for those who are professional authors e.g. Curtis Poe, brian d foy, Gabor Szabo, Dave Cross and many more. Ever since I started the weekly challenge, I became more involved in writing technical blog. Soon I realised it is not the same as writing a technical book. But the urge inside me to become an author didn't die forever. With recent Dave's blog kind of fan the idea once again. I became charged one more time but this time I am seriously thinking about it. I had a topic that I wanted to explore for sometimes. I discussed it with Gabor and Dave and got very positive response. So it is official I am now working on my first book, soon to be published by Dave Cross. Fingers Crossed. Life is so beautiful when you have friends like Gabor and Dave who always encourage and guide you.",
     "There is another story that I would like to share about. Andrew Shitov reached out to me few days ago if I am interested to share my Raku story in the upcoming <a href=\"https://conf.raku.org/\">The Raku Conference</a>. I have accepted the offer and working on it. I haven't submitted my talk yet but will do so soon. Do you have Raku story to share? If yes then please do submit your talk before the deadline.",
     "One last story of the week and I would go away. Many of you know that I have been running the Perl Weekly Challenge for more than 2 years now. It started as a weekly challenge aimed for Perl and Raku community but soon it spread out to other languages. As of today, we now have received contributions in over 50 different languages. Latest addition is <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/crystal-binary-palindrom\">Crystal programming language</a> by none other than the Gabor Szabo himself. Long time ago, don't remember who, proposed to me to register a generic domain instead of perlweeklychallenge.org. I didn't waste the time and registered the new domain theweeklychallenge.org. Having registered the new domain, I didn't have the courage and expertise to switch over the actively used live site to another domain. I made a request in this regard on Facebook and guess what? Dave Cross came up with step-by-step guide to do the domain switch. I was still very nervous to take the risk. Then came the final blow with Gabor asking the same question why don't I move domain to a generic domain. To cut the long story short, Gabor and I spent an hour or so yesterday, (Sunday afternoon), got the domain switch over. So we now have new domain the weekly challenge: <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">theweeklychallenge.org</a>. Thank you Gabor and Dave for all the support and guidance.",
