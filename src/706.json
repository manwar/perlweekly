     "Hi there,",
     "Last weekend was busy with the <strong>FOSDEM 2025</strong>. Did you get the chance to attend the grand event? As always, this time too, we had <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> booth at the event. There was even an <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/osdem25\">official statement</a> from the <strong>TPF</strong> urging all members to join the <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> communities. The venue is not too far from where I live (London), yet I have never attended. In fact, I have never been to <strong>FOSDEM</strong> though every year I plan to attend and end up missing it.",
     "While looking for more information, I came across this gem: <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/perl_in_2025\">Perl in 2025</a>. This was part of <strong>FOSDEM 2021</strong> by the master himself, <strong>Paul Evans</strong>. If you take a closer look, you will realise we are <strong>almost</strong> there. Being human, we are never satisfied and always want more. It is easy to demand more but very hard to give time and energy.",
     "If you remember, I mentioned about the GitHub repository for <strong>PPC</strong> in the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/696.html\">Perl Weekly newsletter</a>. Now I hear, this will be exposed as <strong>GitHub pages</strong> as shared in this two parts post: <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2025/01/proposed-perl-changes\">part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2025/02/proposed-perl-changes-part-2\">part 2</a> by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>.",
     "Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please do take extra care of yourself."
