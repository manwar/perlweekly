      "Hi there",
      "Take a look at the <a href=\"http://perlweekly.com/archive/1.html\">first edition</a> of Perl Weekly Newsletter launched on 1st August 2011. I know many subscribers personally who always look forward to the weekly newsletter. Since the launch of the newsletter, the Chief Editor, Gabor Szabo, have had many helping hands e.g. Yanick Champoux, Neil Bowers, D Ruth Holloway and Upasana Shukla. I joined the panel of editors in the month of May 2018.",
      "The other thing that made lots of noise last week was the <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org\">Perl Weekly Challenge</a>. Today it is launched with the first <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/a-new-week-a-new-challenge/\">challenge</a>.
