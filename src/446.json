      "Hi there",
      "Taking forward Gabor Szabo, the chief editor of PerlWeekly newsletter, raising the issue of less online footprint for Perl. I am sure we all agree that not much noise is generated in the last year or so. Having said that there are still few dedicated Perl enthusiasts who are still keeping the Perl focussed discussion very much alive. One of the prominent and respected member of the Perl Community, Toby Insker, came up with an <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/toby_inkster/2020/02/increasing-perls-visibility.html\">innovative idea</a>. I am very excited with the idea and would definitely work on it in near future.",
      "Wish you a great week ahead. Have fun reading the newsletter. Please do share you suggestions."
