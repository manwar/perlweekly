      "The biggest event of the year 2020 is coming short. If you haven't had chance to book your place the please do so. For more information about the ticket, please <a href=\"https://tpc20cic.sched.com/tickets\">follow this link</a>. It is going to be a mix of Perl and Raku topics. I am particular looking forward to Damian Conway talk as I have never attended his live talk.",
      "With regard to the project I was supposed to launch today got delayed because of technical reason. But I am confident we would launch it with a bang in a couple of days time, apology for the delay. I am waiting for that moments anxiously.",
      "Last week, I started doing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT91RkThBWByo1NL_M8R8Ig\">YouTube video</a> for \"The Weekly Challenge\" tasks. I had good laugh doing it as it was my first time doing anything like this. I had very encouraging response so far. I hope to continue as long as possible.",
      "Last but not the least, maintain social distancing and stay safe. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
