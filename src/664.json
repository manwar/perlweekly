     "Hi there,",
     "Today is the <strong>Day 1</strong> of the <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/index.html\">German Perl Workshop 2024</a>. It is going to be very busy week for those attending the annual event. As per the <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/schedule?day=2024-04-15\">schedule</a>, <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> is giving talk on <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/talk/7866\">AIâ€”This Talk is Always Out of Date</a>. I am pretty sure, it is going to be very popular among the attendees. Most of the talks are going to be in <strong>German</strong> as expected. English speaking attendees shouldn't worry as there would be some talks in <strong>English</strong> too. The team behind the GPW is so friendly and welcoming that you would never get bored throughout the day. It feels great to see how they have managed to organise the event every year. There was a time when <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong> used to be so popular that attracted attendees from as far as <strong>Japan</strong> just for one day event. <strong>Lee Johnson</strong> has been pushing hard to make it happen this year. Please show your interest in good numbers if you are LPW fans. Finding Sponsor is the biggest hurdle, if I am not mistaken. I just hope we don't miss the opportunity this year.",
     "Recently I got the shocking news about my friend, <strong>Dave Hodgkinson</strong>. There was a <strong>Facebook</strong> post sharing the news that <strong>Dave</strong> passed away last <strong>December</strong>. I have had the honour to meet him at every LPW event. He would never miss the opportunity to catch up his friends. He was also regular to the <strong>London Perl Mongers</strong> meetup. In the last few years when the event didn't happen, he was actively engaging with friends on <strong>Facebook</strong>. I used to chat with him on <strong>Facebook messenger</strong> regularly. I still have his message wishing me good luck when I joined <strong>Oleeo</strong>. This news really shocked me. Last <strong>December</strong> was so depressing time for me, as I lost my <strong>Mom</strong> on Boxing day. This is a small tribute to my buddy, <strong>Dave</strong>. May his soul rest in peace.",
     "Please take extra care of your health and your loved ones."
