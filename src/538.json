      "Hi there",
      "Going back to the editorial of last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/537.html\">edition</a> of weekly newsletter, it is still there in my head asking many questions. It is universal fact, Perl is no longer the favourite language among the youths in the college these days. I remember when I was first introduced to Perl in 1999, it was the most popular language. Being a Perl fan, I feel it is my responsibility to bring Perl back to discussion table. One way to do is to talk about Perl based project and share with audience of others language. I have noticed not many people blog about Perl as they used to in the past. Talking about blogs, I would like to thank <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> team for spreading the power of Perl. For record, in the last 138 weeks, the team have created and shared over 2000 blogs. I used to blog regularly in the past but now a days I hardly find time. Having said, I still do monthly report blog where I talk about Perl and other projects. I find doing live video is less time consuming than writing a blog. I did it for sometimes and then I stopped that as well, sorry. You can take a look my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube Channel</a> if you fancy. I came across series of <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course\">videos</a> by Gabor Szabo teaching Perl. It is great source for someone new to Perl and explore with live action.",
      "I remember, Dave Cross, wrote a <a href=\"https://dev.to/davorg/don-t-be-a-perl-programmer-4h2d\">blog</a> talking about something not many people would speak about. I personally agree with him fully and believe knowing more than one programming languages help you as a programmer.I can tell from my own experience, I picked up Raku last year while participating the weekly challenge. Whatever little I know about Raku till date, I can tell it has helped me a lot. I use that knowledge to write better Perl program. Recently I started doing Python as well just the basics for now. So the question is, does knowing Raku or Python make me any less Perl programmer? I am still Perl programmer and all thought process still follow Perl rules. Perl is my first love and will remain so rest of my life. Even today, after more than 22 years, I find features that I never knew existed before, specially in the field of regex. I would like to give credits to Abigail for sharing the magical regex in Perl as part of his weekly contributions.",
      "While talking about blog, how can I miss those who are doing great service on a regular basis? I would like to thank <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY\">Flavio Poletti</a> for blogging every day for months now. Also there is another name, <a href=\"https://phoenixtrap.com\">Mark Gardner</a> who does weekly blog. Similarly we have weekly stats by <a href=\"https://niceperl.blogspot.com\">Miguel Prz</a>.",
