      "Hi there",
      "Recently Perl Toolchain Summit 2019 event took place in the town of Marlow, UK between Thursday April 25th and Sunday 28th 2019. For those who don't know what PTS is? The Perl Toolchain summit is an opportunity for the developers and maintainers of Perl's infrastructure to get together and do whatever is necessary to keep that infrastructure running well and improve its services. This is invite only event.",
      "During the event, there were regular photo updates on Twitter to get the view what is happening. I met Lee Johnson, one of the attendee, the following day. I really wanted to meet all of them personally as the venue was not far from where I live. It is rare to see so many gurus in one place. I didn't want to turn up without invitation and embarass myself.",
      "I wanted to be involved in MetaCPAN project, so that one day I also get invitation. Unfortunately setting up MetaCPAN locally is not easy. Paul johnson, another attendee at PTS, told me that there was some discussion going on to make the process simple and straight forward. I am eagerly waiting for it.",
      "In the mean time, if you want looking for the event's photo, then take a look at Wendy's collection <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wendyga/40739430963/in/album-72157708113286765/\">here</a>",
      "Enjoy and have fun rest of the week. "
