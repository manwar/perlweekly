         "Hi there,",
        "As we all know, German Perl/Raku Workshop 2024 happend few weeks ago, it turned out to be lucky for <strong>LPW 2024</strong>. After GPW, we got the official announcement of <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/04/announcing-the-london-perl-and-raku-workshop-2024-lpw.html\">LPW 2024</a>. It is going to be one day event as per the tradition. The tentative date as of today is <strong>26th October 2024</strong> and it is <strong>Saturday</strong>. If you are <strong>FREE</strong> then don't forget to plan your visit in advance. It is returning after a gap of <strong>5 years</strong>. It would be a special event for one more reason as it would be the <strong>20th anniversay</strong> in terms of years. I am very happy to see the support we already got. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> shared the news that he has submitted <strong>4 talks</strong> already. If you are planning to attend then please submit your talk as well. <stron>LPW</strong> always encourage first time speakers. If you can't make it full length talk then you can even submit <strong>5 minutes</strong> lightning talk. To my surprise, as soon as annoucement was public, <a href=\"https://geekuni.com/corporate-perl-training\">Geekuni</a> became the <strong>Silver Sponsor</strong>. Ofcourse, we are looking for more sponsors. If your workplace codebase uses <strong>Perl</strong> then I would suggest you please speak to the management if they are willing to sponsor the event. You can find more details about <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html\">different sponsor packages</a>.",
        "There is another big event happening in <strong>Las Vegas</strong> and it is <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las\">The Perl and Raku Conference</a> from <strong>24-28 June 2024</strong>. The event organisers made a <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tprc2024vol\">Call for Volunteers</a>. I had plan to attend the event with family as it is happening in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>. Now the circumstance is such that even my own visit is not confirmed. It would be a big loss if I don't make it to <strong>Las Vegas</strong> this time.",
        "Do you remember the last major release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>? It was special because of the inclusion of <strong>Corinna</strong>. I am hoping, in the next release <strong>Perl v5.40</strong>, we get more features added to <strong>Corinna</strong>. According to <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/5fdf6e90221900a85cd3091bd2755e41fc230d4d/Porting/release_schedule.pod?plain=1#L54\">this document</a>, the tentative release date is <strong>20th May 2024</strong>.",
        "The post series <strong>What's new on CPAN ...</strong> on <a href=\"https://www.perl.com\">perl.com</a> is my all time favourite. Recently it got fresh air and we had 4 in a row e.g. <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-november-2023\">Nov 23</a>, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-december-2023\">Dec 23</a>, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-january-2024\">Jan 24</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-february-2024\">Feb 24</a>. It is nearly end of <strong>Apr 24</strong> and we have not seen the post for <strong>Mar 24</strong>. I just hope and wish, the tradition doesn't die. I am keeping my fingers crossed.",
