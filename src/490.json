      "Hi there",
      "The term \"Elevator Pitch Day\" coined by one of the respected member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Facebook Perl Programmers</a> group. I liked the idea behind it as mentioned in the post. The core idea is to invite members to organise a virtual meet to discuss all those awesome startup idea out there. It would be nice to find out who we can get to attend that has money/connections/resources to try and make it happen. Would you be interested to join us? I am definitely up for it.",
      "I came across another hate <a href=\"https://content.techgig.com/top-4-most-hated-programming-languages-in-2020/articleshow/79595684.cms\">blog post</a>. I am tired of such crap. Although I don't see it as regular as before. I was happy to see few big names responded with facts and figures. We should continue promote the idea of putting Perl in non-Perl blogging site. I have seen a big rise in recent weeks as far as the weekly challenge is concerned.",
      "Lets change the topic and talk about positive vibes. Dave Cross wrote an inspiring <a href=\"https://dev.to/davorg/the-story-behind-a-new-module-2gkp\">blog</a> where he shared the story behind his new module <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::App::DirectoryIndex\">Plack::App::DirectoryIndex</a>. I am confident it would inspire others to contribute to CPAN. Another <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/\">blog post</a> recommended by Dave talking about how to get started with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).",
      "Couple of weeks ago, I requested the Dancer2 core team to get Advent Calendar 2020 going in the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/488.html\">weekly newsletter</a>. I am so happy to see it happening finally. Thank you Jason Crome for <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2020/12/the-twelve-days-of-dancer-2020-edition.html\">The Twelve Days of Dancer, 2020 Edition</a>. It is no longer a secret that Dancer2 is one of my favourite web application framework. Talking about Dancer2, why don't you join the <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/c/dancer\">Perl Dancer Course</a> run by Gabor Szabo? It is yet another quality material for all Perl lovers. I am confident you will enjoy it.",
      "Last but not the least, enjoy the festive season keeping safe distance."
