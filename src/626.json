      "Hi there,",
      "I am sure you have followed <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference 2023 in Toronto</strong> whether as attendee or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA/videos\">watching the videos</a>. I was fortunate to attend the conference and meet the who's who of <strong>Perl Community</strong>. The highlight of the conference for me was the keynote, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT0S-jfO1mE\">Coming soon ...</a>, presented by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>. It was during the keynote, we were introduced to a new project, <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl-Oshun/oshun\">Oshun</a>. Since the release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, we have all been introduced to <strong>Corinna</strong>, a modern OO to the <strong>Perl</strong> core. <strong>Oshun</strong> is the next big thing after <strong>Corinna</strong>. To be honest, it is really cool idea and I can't wait it to be included in the <strong>Perl</strong> core. I know it is in early stage right now but I am glad it is in safe hand.",
      "I would also like to mention about another talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0\">No one is immune to abuse</a> by <strong>Sawyer X</strong>. I was lucky enough to be in the audience. In general, we are proud of the friendly and encouraging nature of the <strong>Perl</strong> community but it is also fact that you do come across few who are not too friendly. I could relate to what was shared in the talk as I have experienced the abuse myself during the early days of <strong>[The/Perl] Weekly Challenge</strong>. I must confess it took me months to recover from it. Those who are part of the weekly challenge must have noticed it too. I stopped participating in the weekly challenge for sometime and kept myself limited to managing the challenge as opposed to contributing to the weekly challenge in <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>, writing <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">blog posts</a> and making <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube videos</a> for the same. I did come back few months later and participated again but it didn't last long.",
      "If you missed the conference this year then you have plenty of time to book your place at <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2024</a> which is going to be held in sunny <strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>.",
      "We also had surprise announcement by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> with regard to the <a href=\"https://cfp.perladvent.org\">Perl Advent Calendar 2023 CFP</a>. I missed the deadline last year and couldn't find a place in the <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022\">Perl Advent Calendar 2022</a>. I will make sure this time, I submit my proposal well before the deadline. If you have something to share with the rest of the community then I would request you to come forward and submit your proposals.",
      "Last but not the least, the next big event, <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi\">Perl and Koha Conference 2023</a> is happening next month. You can find the <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi/Schedule.html\">schedule</a> of the event. I am going to miss the event as it is clashing with my home visit to <strong>India</strong>. I hope and wish you all have great time.",
      "Thank you <strong>Gabod</strong> for the space in the editorial of last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/625.html\">newsletter</a>. It means a world to me. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
