      "Hi there",
      "I am not sure if you have read recent <a href=\"http://neilb.org/2021/04/27/perl-communities.html\">blog</a> by Neil Bowers. I read it multiple times to understand subject of the blog. I must admit, I never read such an in depth analysis of the term \"Community\". As it is my vocabulary is very limited, I found very interesting to such a long blog. To me, community is group of likeminded people. When I attended the first London Perl Workshop, I immediately felt part of the community. The organiser and everybody was so accomodating and friendly. It made me come again the following year and I became addicted to it afterwards. I always looked up to the big names of the community everytime I needed some inspiration. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/\">past recipients</a> of White Camel Award, you can get the idea of who's who in the community. Unfortunately it hasn't been awarded since 2018 for some reason that I am not aware of. I miss the community spirit of attending Perl Conference. You can never experience the feeling unless you attend one. I hope and wish we get back to attending Conferences. Although there has been virtual events in recent time but it can't replace the real events in my humble opinion. I must give credits to everyone who is keeping the community spirit alive.",
