There is a lot of merit in what he is say and what he is writing in this article. I personally would go to the most extreme and use a Docker container for better separation and to make the development, testing, and production environments as similar as possible. With that said I am not 100% sold on the idea. I do understand the value in using the perl that comes with the OS and the perl modules that can be installed with the package-management system of the operating system. (e.g. apt/yum).
