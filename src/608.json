      "Hi there,",
      "My 6 years old twins reminded me on Sunday morning about Mother's Day. Although I didn't even know such day existed when I was in India but this country exposed me to all kind of celebrations. I miss my mom a lot. Let me share with you one of my childhood memory. During my school days, everytime somebody complain to my mom about my fight she wouldn't listen to my side of story. In fact she would start beating me up infront of the complainant. All my so-called friends knew this and they would blackmail me all the time. My mom would never defend me and believe what others have to say about me. I hated it to the bottom of my heart. This affected my personality and made me an introvert. I have been fighting with my nature all my life, even today.",
      "I see the similar treatment to my beloved programming language <strong>Perl</strong>. It pains me when I see some <strong>Perl Gurus</strong> never defend the language same like my mom. I expect them to show the bright side of the language to the rest of the world instead, being the language guru. Even a single negative statement about <strong>Perl</strong> would take us one step back and create a bad image. I am fully aware of all the shortcomings but I am not going to go out and tell everyone about it. I would rather find the solutions, if I can. There is nothing wrong to try other programming languages from the job prospective. In fact, I have recently played with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>, thanks to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> but <strong>Perl</strong> remains my first choice of programming language.",
      "I know I don't blog regularly any more but I have done it in the past every time I have done something nice using <strong>Perl</strong>. You can find some of them <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar\">bpo</a>. I know there are many <strong>Perl</strong> fans out there doing their bits to dust off the negative image. Honestly speaking, we need more people to come forward. For example, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> has been running dedicated website, <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com\">Perl Maven</a> where he showcase the cool features of <strong>Perl</strong>.",
      "I have seen some of the brightest brain creating magic using <strong>Perl</strong> every week when it comes to solving the weekly challenge. The best part is that they even share the code with others on various platforms like <strong>Facebook</strong>.",
      "Last but not the least, <strong>Happy Mother's Day</strong> to all the moms out there, including mine who is in India right now. I love you mom. I would like to apologise to all the readers of the newsletter about the last week incident when I couldn't get my contributions to the newsletter available on time. I will try to be more organised in future, promise."
