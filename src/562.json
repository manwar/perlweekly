      "I wish all the readers of the weekly newsletter, a very <strong>Happy Idd</strong>. We are celebrating Idd today in England and luckily it is a <strong>Bank Holiday</strong> as well.",
      "I have seen Facebook post about the upcoming <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2022, Houston, TX</a>. With this, I kept wonderung why not have <strong>London Perl Workshop 2022</strong> too? Being member of the LPW organising team, I discussed it with fellow member, <strong>Julien</strong>. Good news is he seems positive about it as well. I don't know whether we have enough time to kickstart the process. Just hoping we get the opportunity to organise the conference. It has been a long time since we last had the gatherings in London. We had German Perl Workshop organised successfully only recently. Although I didn't see a single event report published by attending members unfortunately. I remember last time when I attended the <strong>German Perl Workshop</strong>, there were plenty of post event reports published as per the tradition.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
