      "Hi there",
      "In the PerlWeekly Newsletter <a href=\"http://perlweekly.com/archive/396.html\">Issue 396</a>, I proposed the idea of \"Perl Weekly Challenge\". I have since got very positive response so far. In the next couple of weeks, I would official launch the challenge. If you want to have fun and challenge yourself, be it Perl 5 or Perl 6, then drop me a line at mohammad.anwar@yahoo.com. You don't have to be an expert to join the challenge.",
      "On 28th Feb 2019, we had our first London.PM Tech Meet, During the event, I proposed the idea of Hack Day. One person sitting in the audience later told me that Sue Spence did something similar in the past. I contacted her and she gave me some very usefull ideas. This is still in the design stage. I would like to request anyone keen to be part of \"London Hack Day\" then please get in touch with me. Or if you have any suggestions then please drop me a line.",
      "Coming back to the talk of the town, the most popular German Perl Workshop 2019. It was held in Munich this year with great speakers as usual. if you missed the event for any reason then take a look at the slides of some of the talks list down below.",
