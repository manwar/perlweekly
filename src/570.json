      "Hi there",
      "I noticed a fresh air and renewed energy among <strong>Perl Hackers</strong> ever since the latest release of <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>. I can only imagine what would be the reaction when <strong>Corinna</strong> becomes part of core Perl. It would definitely help <strong>Perl</strong> regain its glory, in my humble opinion.",
      "As some of you are aware that I have been doing daily <strong>Perl</strong> feature series for sometimes now, I have seen so much interest in the new/improved features brought in <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>. All credit goes to the hard work and dedication of the team responsible for the release. I have got all the daily feature posts saved in the <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a> for anyone to checkout. I am pleasantly surprised to see the repository quicky getting to the <strong>Top 3</strong> popular repostories on my <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar\">GotHub dashboard</a>.",
      "Do you remember <a href=\"http://cpan-weekly.org\">CPAN Weekly</a>?",
      "It was created and managed by <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>. I still remember the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/02/cpan-weekly-one-module-per-week-in-your-inbox.html\">public announcement</a>. I really enjoyed the weekly email. I still have it saved in my email inbox. It is priceless treasure that I don't want to loose. So I decided to drop a line on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpan_author\">twitter handle</a>, asking shouldn't it get a <strong>reboot</strong>?",
      "I got plenty of support for the reboot. Even <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> responded with a warning, <strong>\"resist the temptation of do it myself, instead encourage others to take it on\"</strong>. Who knows my workload better than me. I knew if I wanted to do this just by myself then it would be hard to justify the legacy started by original creator, <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>. I was lucky to find a helping hand in no time. She is also member of <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">Team PWC</a>. I have seen her growth ever since she joined the team. I am lucky to have her in the team. She responded with <strong>2 emails</strong> so far detailing her thought process. It is still in early discussion stage, I will share more details when we have initial draft ready. We are not in a rush, to be honest. The more help I get the better it is going to be.",
      "One more thing, I would like to talk about recently concluded, <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/schedule\">The Perl and Raku Conference in Houston</a>. I really wanted to attend in person and meet everyone. I missed the live streaming of the talks. Never mind, we now have all the talks recorded. Please go and pick your favourite one from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFyOpb-U3DMU7OT93dPUdtpE\">YouTube Playlist</a>. I would like to mention couple, I have seen so far from the list that I loved it and they are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5IyYyvWHU\">Taming the Unicode Beast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lSdBSCkFGs\">Corinna Status, 2022</a>. When I have spare time, I will definitely go through each one by one.",
      "I am not sure about others but I miss event reports by the attendees of <strong>Perl</strong> conference. I remember, in good old days, we would get plenty of such event reports. It used to give nice perspective from the attendee point of view. I wish and hope, we get some this time around. Talking about <stron>Perl</strong> conference, I am sad that <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong> is not happening this year too. I am hoping the year <strong>2023</strong> can be the lucky year for <strong>LPW</strong>.",
