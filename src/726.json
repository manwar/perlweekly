     "Hi there,",
     "Most of us have explored and seen the power of <strong>ChatGPT</strong>. Last week, <strong>Dave Cross</strong> shared very interesting tool written in <strong>Perl</strong> to create podcast for weekly newsletter. We already have podcast for <a href=\"https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-723.mp3\">Week #723</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-724.mp3\">Week #724</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-725.mp3\">Week #725</a>. I am very impressed with the content and sound quality. Great job, <strong>Dave</strong>. You can checkout the code in the <a href=\"https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod\">GitHub repository</a>.",
     "Another post, <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/a-slice-of-perl\">Slice of Perl</a> by <strong>Dave Cross</strong> inspired me to write about <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/array-vs-list\">Array vs List</a> in <strong>Perl</strong>.",
     "For all <strong>Dancer2</strong> fan, we have a good news, very soon there would be <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2025/06/upcoming-dancer2-200-release.html\">Dancer2 2.0.0</a> release. I am very excited and looking forward to it.",
