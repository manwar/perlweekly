      "Hi there,",
      "By the time you read this newsletter, I would be on the flight to <strong>Toronto</strong> to attend <a href=\"https://tprc2023.sched.com\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2023</a>. I hope and wish to meet many experts and learn from their experience.",
      "In the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/622.html\">issue 622</a>, I mentioned that <strong>Perl v5.38</strong> is coming soon. Then a week later, <strong>Gabor</strong> announced the arrival of latest release in the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/623.html\">issue 623</a>. I was pleasantly surprised by the early release. I would like to take this opportunity and thank all involved in the release. Special mention to <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> and his team for the work on <strong>Corinna</strong>. To me it is one of the most anticipated feature. To me, it is not just another release but a very special one. Therefore I was expecting it to be the talk of the town. Unfortunately I didn't come across any such noise. In fact, the <strong>Perl v5.36</strong> was more discussed on various social platform. I even collected my experiment with <strong>Perl v5.36</strong> in the <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a>.",
      "As of today, the latest release is one week old and I finally managed to install it on my <strong>Windows WSL (Ubuntu 20.04)</strong>. Plan is to extend the above mentioned repository and record my experiment with <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>. I have recorded the installation steps in the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/manwar/868aeb07ef4b445b55f726b02a79544d\">gist</a>, if you are interested.",
      "For all the german speaking readers, we have <a href=\"https://blog.perl-academy.de\">blog posts</a> with the regard to the <strong>Perl v5.38</strong> by <strong>Renee Baecker</strong>. Talking about blog post, we have another <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/corinna-in-the-perl-core.html\">detailed post</a> by the lead designer of Corinna, <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>. I would also like to mention another name here, <strong>Andrew Shitov</strong>, mostly known for his work on <strong>Raku</strong>, sharing his <a href=\"https://andrewshitov.com/2023/07/06/built-in-classes-in-perl-5-38\">solution</a> to the task <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-224/#TASK1\">Special Notes</a> of <strong>Week #224</strong> using the new <strong>class feature</strong> of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>.",
      "<strong>Who owns the Camel logo?</strong>",
      "Well it is long outstanding issue, so much talked about it but unfortunately nothing happened so far. I just hope and wish it gets resolved soon. I came across this <a href=\"https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/open-letter-to-tim-oreilly-to-free-the-perl-camel-k3i\">Open Letter</a> by <strong>Thibault Duponchelle</strong>.",
