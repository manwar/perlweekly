      "I borrowed the title from Curtis recently shared <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/5205534f7dcc52e4d931aaff301b39aa\">gist</a>. I am sure everyone of us have dealt with exceptions in Perl. Being a <a href=\"https://metacpan.org\">CPAN</a> fan, I found plenty of choices readily available. I am a big fan of <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/Try-Tiny\">Try::Tiny</a> and has been my first choice always to deal with exceptions in Perl. I suggest you must check out the gist for more insights and suggestions shared by Curtis.",
      "I would also like to share another gem by Curtis, i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Porting-from-Moose-or-Moo\">Porting from Moose or Moo</a>. It is a big help for anyone to move to Corinna from Moose or Moo. Most of my personal work shared on <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/author/MANWAR\">MetaCPAN</a> used Moo. The document by Curtis would be handy when porting to Corinna once it is part of core Perl. I am eagerly waiting for it to happen.",
      "Finally, this is my <strong>99th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter. In two weeks time, I would be presenting the <strong>100th edition</strong>. I joined the team of editors in <strong>May 2018</strong>, thanks to the chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>, for all the support and guidance.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter and pray for the world peace."
