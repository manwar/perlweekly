      "Hi there,",
      "I am a big fan OOP and can't wait to see Modern Object in Perl, <strong>Corinna</strong>, to be part of core Perl. Last update I had was in early January by <strong>Curtis</strong>. You can checkout the <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2022/01/msg262335.html\">details here</a>.",
      "If you are new to <strong>Corinna</strong> then I would recommend you checkout <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Porting-from-Moose-or-Moo\">this post</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong>. Those who don't know, <strong>Curtis</strong> is leading the team working on <strong>Corinna</strong>.",
      "Talking about OOP, I came across another <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/common-problems-in-object-oriented-code.html\">post</a> by none other than <strong>Curtis</strong> himself sharing the common issues with OO code. This should be taught to anyone starting OO in any language and not just Perl, in my humble opinion. Having read it few times already from start to end in one go, I keep going back to it to keep myself reminded about it all the time. You would definitely want to bookmark it for future reference.",
      "Few weeks ago, I shared post <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/why-is-object-oriented-programming-bad.html\">Why is Object-Oriented Programming Bad?</a> by Curtis. My favourite line in the post, <strong>\"I think there’s a good case to be made that OOP is not nearly as useful as it’s claimed.\"</strong>. Mind you, this is coming from <strong>Curtis</strong>.",
      "Enough of OO, lets talk about <strong>Exceptions in Perl</strong>, I would like to share the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/5205534f7dcc52e4d931aaff301b39aa\">blog post</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> (once again), where he points out the common issue in Perl. It reminded me about my recent <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v534/try-catch.pl\">post</a> sharing the new try/catch block in <strong>Perl v5.34</strong>.",
      "Last but not the least, please find this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/0ef90f9f48f04fdad5d2ee8204fab776\">gem</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> talking about testing database operations with a fresh instance of SQLite everytime. I wonder, if this can be shared as <strong>CPAN module</strong>. Just thinking out loud, I know.",
