     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>Did you get the opportunity to attend YAPC::Hiroshima?</strong>",
     "Looking at whatever news is out in public about the conference, it appears to be a big success. A big round of applause to everyone involved. <strong>Makoto Nozaki</strong> shared his experience in the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2024/02/yapchiroshima-i-attended-yapchiroshima-in-japan.html\">blog post</a>. There were regular updates shared on Twitter profiles e.g. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kfly8\">kobaken</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yapcjapan\">yapcjapan</a>. <strong>Japan</strong> is one of few places that I always wanted to visit. I still remember when I was in college my mom asked me she wanted to see <strong>Tokyo</strong> city. I casually promised her that time. But when I moved to <strong>England</strong> she kept reminding me about my promise but for health reason she couldn't travel. I was first introduced to the city when I watched the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_Tokyo\">Love in Tokyo</a>. I think <strong>YAPC Japan</strong> would be the perfect excuse to fulfill my mom's wish. <strong>Israel</strong> is also one place that I would like to visit once in my life time and meet <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> in person.",
     "<strong>How about upcoming TPRC 2024 in Las Vegas?</strong>",
     "I remember when it was annonced at the end of conferece in <strong>Toronto</strong> last year, there was big cheers all around. I could feel the positive energy. There was a call for <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/index.php/volunteer\">volunteer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/tprclas24\">presentation</a>. If I managed to find time and health permit then I would definite go to <strong>Las Vegas</strong>. I am sure it is going to beat the <strong>Toronto</strong> experience. I would submit the talk only when I am 100% sure to travel. I really miss the similar gatherings in <strong>Europe</strong>. Talking about conference, what's happening to <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong>? Don't you miss <strong>LPW</strong>? I honestly hope it happens this year and we get to meet local champions. It is the only time, I get to meet my idols like <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> and <strong>Dave Cross</strong>. There is also a friend of mine, <strong>Theo van Hoesel</strong, regulars to <strong>LPW</strong> and <strong>London Perl Mongers</strong> meetup, I miss him. I remember during one such meetup he gave short presentation on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09iUEbgmmxg\">Iphone iOS scripting</a>. I simply loved it. His ability to present difficult topic looks easy, is commendable. Let's bring back the golden moments.",
     "Back to reality, the schools are open today after a week long holiday here in <strong>London</strong>. Too much trouble, I wonder how parents cope up with this routine. I just go with the flow, no choice. You look after yourself and loved ones. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
