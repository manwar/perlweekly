      "Hi there,",
      "Actually, belated <strong>Happy Birthday Perl</strong> as it was celebrated on <strong>December 18th</strong>. It falls in the middle of festive season, making it is to miss it. However, there are some <strong>Perl</strong> fans, who make sure it is celebrated with full energy. I came across a very interesting <a href=\"https://perl.beginners.narkive.com/awGuE6yz/geeky-way-to-wish-happy-birthday-through-perl\">post talking about a geek way to wish Happy Birthday</a>.",
      "Speaking of celebrations, the <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html\">Day 23</a> of <strong>Perl Advent Calendar 2024</strong> featured a proposal for the <strong>Perl</strong> logo. Thank you, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> for taking the discussion to a conclusion. We've had many discussions in the past but nothing came out of them. I am very happy to finally have a logo that represents the <strong>Perl</strong> language. It is also a universal truth, <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Camel</strong> can't be separated.",
      "By the way, did you know that <strong>TPRF</strong> announced the <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/white-camel-2024\">White Camel Award 2024</a> few days ago? <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> finally joined the club, though a bit late but never mind. Thank you, <strong>TPRF</strong> for choosing the best. For those who don't know, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>, is the person behind the successfull running of the <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2024/index.html\">Perl Advent Calendar 2024</a>. Although each day presents an interesting and thoughtfull topic but my personal favourite is the live session with <strong>Randal Schwartz</strong>. I was lucky enough to attend the live event. The timing was perfect for me (London) around <strong>11 pm</strong>. Don't worry if you missed it, be sure to checkout out: <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html\">Half My Life with Perl</a>.",
      "On <strong>December 18th</strong>, the first <strong>Perl Community Conference 2024</strong> was held as a hybrid in-person-and-online event. I didn't get to attend it but I <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/12/pcc-winter-24-follow-up---future-plans-announced.html\">read</a> it was well attended. Congratulations to everyone for the successfull event. The recently concluded <strong>London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024</strong> <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/12/london-perl-raku-workshop-2025-2024-feedback.html\">feedback report</a> has been shared by the organisers. We are now looking for someone who can take the charge of next year's event. If you want to be part of the organising team then please do get in touch with them.",
      "This is my last editorial of the year 2024, so let me take this opportunity to wish all the readers of <strong>Perl Weekly newsletter</strong>, a very happy and healthy Christmas. Enjoy and stay safe with your loved ones. I also noticed this is my <strong>170th</strong> edition. It has been a great learning experience for me so far under the guidance of <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>.",
