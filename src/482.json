      "Hi there",
      "Are you active on Facebook? If yes then you should join the weekly \"Perl Town Hall\" host by Will Braswell. It is weekly live video session every Friday. I do join the show whenever I get time. Because of time difference, it usually comes live midnight Friday. Credit goes to Will for putting up such a nice show mix of Perl news. I just hope if it is available for wider audience outside of Facebook. Feel free to join the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">\"Perl Programmers\"</a>, so that you don't miss the fun every week. The best part is you can interact with him live during the show.",
      "While talking about social platform, how can I miss <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-maven-world/\">\"Code Maven\"</a>, group on LinkedIn. It is run and managed by the Gabor Szabo. Please do join and follow the group for more Perl related posts and videos.",
      "If you follow <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a> then why not check out the weekly review of <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/p5-reviews/\">Perl</a> and <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/p6-reviews/\">Raku</a> by Colin Crain and Andrew Shitov respectively.",
      "I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the support and encouraging emails. It means a world to me. This is my 63rd issue of newsletter. Thank you, Gabor, for guiding me on this journey.",
      "Last but not the least, you take care of yourself and your loved ones. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
