      "Personally I have noticed the fresh energy among all <strong>Perl</strong> fans ever since the release of latest <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>. I am telling this based on the amount of positive noise I heard on various public platform. There are still few in the pipeline that would give further push e.g. <strong>Corinna</strong>. If you are interested to know more then please do checkout this <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki\">page</a> maintained by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>.",
      "<a href=\"https://metacpan.org/recent\">MetaCPAN</a> is another place where you can see all the latest cool <strong>Perl</strong> projects. I know plenty of volunteers helping to improve the code base. If you use a distribution and you like it then why not share your experience with the <strong>Perl Community</strong> and submit your proposal to <a href=\"http://cfp.perladvent.org\">Perl Advent Calendar 2022</a>? Or if you have created one then why not share with rest of the world.",
      "If you are new to <strong>Perl</strong> and needs help then please do give us a shout. There are plenty of help available on various public platforms.",
