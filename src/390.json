      "I hope you are all settling down in your day job after long holiday break. It is time now to book your tickets to your favourite Perl Conferences. There are plenty to choose from, for example, <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2019/index.html\">German Perl Workshop</a>, <a href=\"https://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2019\">DC Baltimore Perl Workshop</a>, <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tpc-2019-pit\">North America Perl Conference</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/perlcon.eu\">European Perl Conference</a>.",
      "If you have booked the tickets already then why don't you send in your proposal for short/lightning talk. One particular event that I am aware of that still accepting proposals is German Perl Workshop. Based on my own experience, you will have a blast there, great people to meet, interesting talks, beautiful location.",
      "Enjoy reading this week newsletter and don't forget to share with your friends."
