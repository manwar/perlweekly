      "Hi there",
      "I am sure you have seen the news of perl.com domain being hacked. It came as shocker to me when someone first reported on Twitter as PM. I thought of it as a bad joke initially. But then I saw tweet from brian d foy about the same. I had to believe in the story then. There were so many speculations going around, not in a good taste. If you are keen in accurate update on the subject then I would recommend please check out the official <a href=\"https://log.perl.org/2021/01/perlcom-hijacked.html\">The Perl NOC</a>.",
      "Ever thought of contributing to Perl core?",
      "I remember, during the peak of my contributions to CPAN, I came across the <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2017/06/i-wrote-some-perl/\">blog</a> by Dave Cross, sharing his first contribution to Perl core. As always the case, I was so inspired by his work, I decided to contribute as well. I did find small documentation patch to contribute. I followed the instructions with regard to contributing to Perl core as shared by Dave. Unfortunately, I never even received the acknowledgement. I doubt it ever made it to release. I don't even have a record of my contribution. In the short, my experience was not so nice. It kind of put me off to be honest. The reason I am sharing the story is because I came across latest <a href=\"https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2021/02/writing-perl-core-feature.html\">blog</a> by Leonardo, on the same topic. It brought back my not-so-happy memory. I hope and wish, it inspires few to contribute to Perl core.",
      "New to Perl? Do you want to find out the Perl magic?",
      "A fresh approach to showcase the magic of Perl. It is always pleasure to read about it. Above all, it is so well written <a href=\"https://dev.to/mjgardner/5-ways-you-can-embrace-the-magic-of-perl-1j11\">blog</a>. Highly recommened for tea break reading. Don't forget to share with newcomers to Perl.",
      "What is it that a developer hates the most?",
      "I am not trying to pass seeping statement. Believe it or not, TDD is thw way forward. We all wants to follow it as well but at times we find reason to skip it. I am guilty of doing the same. But then when I come across <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/managing-a-test-database.html\">blog</a> by Curtis then I feel ashamed of myself. In the blog, he is not just talking about regular testing but he is gone one level up talking about having your own test database. What a novel idea. I am going to re-read one more time to make sure I don't miss any vital suggestions. Engish, not being my first language, there is always a chance I miss something. Therefore I always read the blog atleast twice.",
      "How many of you ever used Stackoverflow to get instant solution?",
      "I doubt you come across any developer who didn't know about Stackoverflow. It is best place to ask any tech related questions. Many years ago, when I was working on my CPAN module <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/Map-Tube\">Map::Tube</a>, I got stuck and couldn't find the right solution. I went to Stackoverflow for help and got the solution in no time. I was very impressed and decided to help others. I setup my account and started to keep an eye on Perl related questions. I quickly found out there are many experienced members who knows the rules inside-out one expect to follow when asking questions or giving answers. A colleague of mine in my office, an expert in Perl, tried his best to fit in but he gave up in the end unfortunatey. What a loss to all of us as a community. My personal opinion is that it is not right place for someone new to the game with the attitude to help others. I may be wrong in my observation. Lets get back to the original point, I saw a post in the \"Perl Programmers\" Facebook group taking about <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66038573/why-does-the-package-qualification-of-symbols-result-in-less-memory-used-even-i/66039392#66039392\">Why does the package qualification of symbols result in less memory used, even if the symbols are imported locally?</a>. I found Evan Carroll response very in-depth and something that make me re-visit the basics. I remember a very famous line, \"You learn something new every day\".",
      "How many of you remember this warning 'wide character in print' when running Perl script?",
      "I have seen this many times in the past, I must admit.  Dave Cross gave an exhaustive solution and cuase of the warning in this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15210532/use-of-use-utf8-gives-me-wide-character-in-print\">thread</a>. This has been my reference guide for years. The reason I am talking about it today is I came across a post <a href=\"https://dev.to/fgasper/perl-unicode-and-bytes-5cg7\">Perl, Unicode, and Bytes</a> by Felipe Gasper. I wish I could explain the subject as good as him in the blog. This is definitely going to be my reference guide collections",
      "Have you taken part in <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge - Perl & Raku</a> before?",
      "If not then this is the best time join the team and have fun. We are currently in the <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-099\">Week #99</a>. So, in theory, we would be celebrating the 100th week next Monday. I am hoping to break the record contributions of week #1. As of today, the record contributions stand at 155 (Perl, Raku and blogs) in the first week. It is within our reach to break the record with the support of 200+ members. Even if only 100 members just contribute to either Perl or Raku solutions to both the tasks, we can easily go past 200 mark. Let us create history and be part of it.",
      "Did you watch last week \"Perl Town Hall\" by Will Braswell? If not then you can still watch the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1828910954/videos/10215697314665745/\">recordings</a>. Have fun and enjoy !!",
      "Last but not least, you take care of yourself and your loved ones."
