      "Hi there",
      "The year 2019 has been very kind to both Perl and Raku community. The hightlight, in my humble opinion, is the renaming of Perl6 to Raku. I hope and wish the new year will bring the two communities together. I have already seen the changes in the <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org\">\"Perl Weekly Challenge\"</a> where members started sharing solutions in Perl and Raku both these days.",
      "It is my honour to present the last edition of the Perl Weekly newsletter of the year 2019. I hope you enjoy the newsletter.",
      "Last but not the least, I wish you all a very happy new year 2020."
