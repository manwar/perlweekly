<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2025-gsp/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was held 2 weeks ago, videos are being uploaded to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sad news: Mark Keating posted that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.shadowcat.co.uk/2025/07/09/ripples-they-cause-in-the-world/&#x22;&#x3E;Matt S. Trout (mst) passed away&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Mark also collected the comments and publications of others.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#728 - Perl Conference</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/728.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week was packed with two major gatherings for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; enthusiasts: &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Community Conference (Hybrid) Summer 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Both events brought together developers, contributors and fans from around the world, whether in person or online.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t attend either conference this time but I&#x27;m eager to catch up on what I missed. If you were there, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experience. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Makoto Nozaki&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has already shared one: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2025/07/tprc-greenville-2025.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thank you for that. If others have insights, talks or highlights to share, please do.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For those curious about the talks, the official &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PCC 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; schedule is available &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlcommunity.org&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I spotted a live talk link on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and joined briefly, but due to audio issues, I had to drop out. Fingers crossed that recordings or slides will be shared soon for those of us who couldn&#x27;t attend fully.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One thing, I noticed this year, there wasn&#x27;t much pre-event promotion for individual talks or maybe I just missed it on social media? Either way, if you couldn&#x27;t make it, keep an eye out for uploaded slides and summaries. There&#x27;s always something new to learn!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x27;s all for now, enjoy the rest of the newsletter and happy coding..&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#727 - Which versions of Perl do you use?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/727.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently I ran a poll asking &#x3C;b&#x3E;Which versions of Perl do you use at work?&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. I asked it both &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/posts/1967801127360837/&#x22;&#x3E;in the The Perl Community group on Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://t.me/PerlMaven&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Maven community Telegram Channel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://t.me/perlp&#x22;&#x3E;Perl 5 Telegram channel&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There were 75 votes in the Facebook group: 1% use 5.42; 17% use 5.40; 30% use 5.38; 5% use 5.36; 29% use 5.22-5.34; 13% use 5.12-5.20; 5% use 5.10 or older.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There were 29 votes in the Telegram group(s): 14% use 5.42; 31% use 5.40; 34% use 5.38; 7% use 5.36; 38% use 5.22-5.34; 17% use 5.12-5.20; 7% use 5.10 or older. Yes, people could select multiple answers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You can still go an vote in either of those polls.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Many people commented that they use the version of perl that comes with the OS, to which Dave Cross posed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/stop-using-your-system-perl/&#x22;&#x3E;Stop using your system Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I don&#x27;t fully agree, but he has a point.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x27;t recall what exactly prompted me to do this, but a few days ago I started to write a book about OOP - Object Oriented Perl. I took some of the slides I had for my advanced Perl course, started to update them and started to write explanations around the examples. As I write them I post the articles in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community group on Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;my LinkedIn page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you use Facebook I&#x27;d recommend you join that group and if you use LinkedIn I&#x27;d recommend you follow me. If you would like to go further and connect with me on LinkedIn, please include a message saying that you are a reader of the Perl Weekly newsletter so I&#x27;ll have some background.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Besides publishing them on the social sites I also collect the writings about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://slides.code-maven.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl OOP&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on my web site and I also started to publish the book on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Leanpub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I am sure you know editing the Perl weekly, writing these examples and articles and the book takes a lot of time that I should spend earning money by helping my clients with their Perl code-base. Luckily there are some people who support me financially via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. (Hint: it would be awesome if you&#x27;d also sponsor me with $10/month.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are many people who like to get something &#x27;tangible&#x27; to really justify their support. If you are such a person I created the Leanpub book especially for you. You can buy the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl-oop/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl OOP book&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and some of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;my other books&#x3C;/a&#x3E; getting a &#x3C;b&#x3E;pdf&#x3C;/b&#x3E; and an &#x3C;b&#x3E;epub&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (for Kindle) version. You will both support my work and get an e-book. You will also get all the new versions of the book as I update it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#726 - Perl and ChatGPT</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/726.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Most of us have explored and seen the power of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ChatGPT&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Last week, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared very interesting tool written in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to create podcast for the Perl Weekly newsletter. We already have podcast for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-723.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #723&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-724.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #724&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod/blob/main/perl-weekly-725.mp3&#x22;&#x3E;Week #725&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am very impressed with the content and sound quality. Great job, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can checkout the code in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/perlweekly2pod&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Another post, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/a-slice-of-perl&#x22;&#x3E;Slice of Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; inspired me to write about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/array-vs-list&#x22;&#x3E;Array vs List&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fan, we have a good news, very soon there would be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2025/06/upcoming-dancer2-200-release.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dancer2 2.0.0&#x3C;/a&#x3E; release. I am very excited and looking forward to it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#725 - Perl podcasts?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/725.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First of all, I&#x27;d like to apologize, I could not get back to every reader of the Perl Weekly who expressed their solidarity and asked if I am in any danger: Thank you for asking! My immediate family and myself, are OK, but it is scary to be targetted by half-a-ton ballistic missiles.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A funny thing happened, someone, called SophoDave, asked if there are any &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1lah0a7/perl_podcasts/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl podcasts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; just when the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/2/&#x22;&#x3E;2nd episode of The Underbar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was published. One person recommended our newsletter to which Olaf Alders suggested someone could read it out aloud.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dave Cross wrote about a Perl script &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/generating-content-with-chatgpt/&#x22;&#x3E;Generating Content with ChatGPT&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Which made me wonder, would it be possible to have some Perl script that would take the content of the Perl Weekly newsletter and using some AI tool would generated a podcast out of it? Any volunteers?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish you a calm week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#724 - Perl and XS</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/724.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What&#x27;s &#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS (eXternal Subroutine)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is a glue language that helps &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; interact with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;C&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sounds simple?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In my personal experience, it&#x27;s not simple at all. I&#x27;ve tried many times but never managed to fully grasp it. Recently, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, shared a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-xs-how-to-create-an-object-24lj&#x22;&#x3E;blog post series&#x3C;/a&#x3E; titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Learning XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which I found very helpful in unraveling its complexity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; also wrote another blog series for newcomers: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-introduction-3d1a&#x22;&#x3E;Learning Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m sure this would be handy for anyone looking to explore &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lately, I&#x27;ve been playing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS S3&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and have shared my experiences in two posts so far:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/localstack-aws-s3&#x22;&#x3E;LocalStack with AWS S3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/aws-s3-encryption&#x22;&#x3E;AWS S3 Encryption&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are plenty more articles in the pipeline, so watch this space!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#723 - Perl Ad Server needs ads</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/723.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am glad that the renewed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1kxbuw2/perl_ad_server_needs_ads/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Ad Server&#x3C;/a&#x3E; seems to be taking off. If you have some Perl-related thing you&#x27;d like to promote to MetaCPAN and other sites displaying the ads, this is your chance to add it to inventory of ads.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you have a Perl-related event that you&#x27;d like to be listed at the bottom of each edition of the Perl Weekly newsletter and included in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, you can do that by sending a Pull-Request.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;d also like to thank all the people who started to support me via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I feel happy that there are people out there who find my contribution valuable to award it with their financial support. I&#x27;d also like to thank the people who decided to support my by buying one of my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;books and courses&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#722 - MetaCPAN and Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/722.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Remember &#x3C;strong&#x3E;search.cpan.org&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was my go to page for finding &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; distributions until &#x3C;strong&#x3E;June, 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, when the service was unfortunately shut down. That&#x27;s when I switched to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Over time, I&#x27;ve come to truly appreciate its power, thanks to the dedicated team of volunteers working tirelessly to keep it running smoothly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Honestly, I never realised how much effort and time went into maintaining such a vast repository of informations, until I spent a few days with the core team at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I have immense respect for their work. It&#x27;s disheartening to hear complaints when the service is slow or down. Instead of criticising, I wish more people would step up to help. That way, they&#x27;d gain a deeper appreciation for what it takes to keep &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; alive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of community efforts, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made a public call for help to upgrade &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from an older version of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1kufqfj/how_is_your_hugo&#x22;&#x3E;(see reddit post here)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Incredibly, there&#x27;s already a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/perldotcom/pull/446&#x22;&#x3E;pull request&#x3C;/a&#x3E; waiting for review, what a turnaround.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I just realised that I&#x27;ve completed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;seven years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as co-editor of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Weekly Newsletter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I joined the team back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May, 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Time flies, incredible!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is bank holiday in England, so I&#x27;m taking it easy. Enjoy the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I asked &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/594&#x22;&#x3E;How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I received quite a few nice comments. Thank you! I&#x27;ll have another question today.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday I asked in a Web 3 group how to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://web3.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;get started with Web3, Blockchain, cryptocurrency, Ethereum&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.... I got a few suggestions including a link to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/blockchain&#x22;&#x3E;Blockchain Roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. So I checked. There is also a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/python&#x22;&#x3E;Python Roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/rust&#x22;&#x3E;Rust roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but I have not found a &#x3C;b&#x3E;Perl Roadmap&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. Not even a community created one. IMHO, if you are interested in making Perl easier to learn, more available and hopefully more popular than you might want to invest some time to create a community roadmap for Perl and maybe even to get it listed as an official roadmap.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Which brings me to my question this week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/601&#x22;&#x3E;What could be done to make Perl more popular?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;d appreciate your comments there.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a totally different subject. I think this might be a good time to mention that if you find my work valuable to you, I&#x27;d appreciate if you could also express it by sponsoring me. GitHub provides a way to make it very easy to give 5-10-20 USD / month to express your gratitude and help me invest more time in the public work. Go to my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub sponsors page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and sign up to sponsor me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today marks the start of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, taking place in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Munich&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May 12-14, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This three-day event promises to be packed with insightful sessions. You can checkout the schedules for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-12&#x22;&#x3E;Day 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-13&#x22;&#x3E;Day 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-14&#x22;&#x3E;Day 3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed several familiar names from the recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, including &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Salve J. Nilsen&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ference Erki&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There are also regular attendees like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Overmeer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Nicholas Clark&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Max Maischein&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Renee Backer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Soren Laird Sorries&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. However, one notable absence is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thomas Klausner&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Looking at the schedule, it&#x27;s shaping up to be a highly impactful event. And yes, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;R Geoffrey Avery&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the Gong man, is also listed as the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lightning Talks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; manager.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As many of you know the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, wrapped up just a week ago and we&#x27;ve already seen plenty of event reports from the participants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This was my first time attending the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, and I&#x27;m grateful to the organisers for the opportunity. While I&#x27;ve been to many &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conferences&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was a completely different experience altogether. The setting allowed for more frequent interaction with attendees, making it easier to seek (and receive) instant help. The knowledge sharing was at its peak, especially with people like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the room. Some participants like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leo Lapworth&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; joined remotely via video conference.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wasn&#x27;t fully prepared as my invitation came at the last minute. In contrast, most attendees had everything well planned. I observed structured groups focusing on specific tasks e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Security&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was free to join any. I chose &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; both because it&#x27;s close to my heart and because of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t have my laptop set up for contributions initially. But thanks to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; environment, I had a working local &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; web instance, in no time. You can read more about my experience in my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/pts-2025&#x22;&#x3E;detailed event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.
