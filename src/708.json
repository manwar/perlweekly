      "Hi there,",
      "There are many interpretations of what it means to grow? I am using the term for new features. We get lots of improvements and new features with every release of <strong>Perl</strong>. In <strong>v5.38</strong>, the experimental <strong>class feature</strong> was rolled out in core. In the next maintenance release of Perl <strong>v5.40</strong>, new field attribute <strong>:reader</strong> was added and many other improvements. The next thing, we all waited was for field attribute <strong>:writer</strong>. Luckily it is already part of development release <strong>v5.41.7</strong>. I made this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/manwar/b7579bf6ba2b8aa05434972d2beb03a3\">gist</a> demonstrating the core changes.",
      "If you are new to <strong>Perl Release Policy</strong> then there are two types of release i.e. <strong>Maintenance</strong> and <strong>Development</strong>. The even numbers are reserved for the maintenance release e.g. <strong>v5.38, v5.40</strong> whereas odd numbers are for the development release e.g. <strong>v5.39, v5.41</strong>. The maintenance release are mostly production ready.",
      "If you are interested in release history then please checkout the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_5_version_history\">version history</a> page. I found an <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/pull/58\">interesting proposal</a> with regard to the version number.",
      "Recently, I got to try the different facets of parallel and concurrent programming. Please find below the list covered so far.",
