     "Hi there,",
     "<strong>December</strong> is normally the busiest month of the year as we get to participate in two events i.e. <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a> and <strong>Advent Calendars</strong> for many programming languages e.g. <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2023\">Perl</a>, <a href=\"https://raku-advent.blog\">Raku</a>, <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2023\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/641.html\">weekly newsletter</a> by <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>, there is an aggregation of <a href=\"http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet\">Advent Calendars</a> managed by <strong>Len Jaffe</strong>.",
     "In the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html\">last edition</a> of newsletter, I requested for sponsor. To my surprise, I have had few offers came through. It is still early stage of discussion. I am hopefull something positive will come out of it. I am keeping fingers crossed.",
     "<strong>Have you contributed to Perl Advent Calendar 2023?</strong>",
     "If not then you should and share your real life experience with Perl. You can find the details on <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent\">GitHub repository</a>. I missed the deadline last year but this year I really didn't want to miss the train. Luckily, thanks to <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and team, my contribution got accepted and merged. It is now allocated <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-10.html\">Day 10</a> in the calendar.",
     "Enjoy the fesive season and look after yourself."
