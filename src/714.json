     "<strong>Happy Idd</strong> to all the weekly newsletter readers who celebrate the festival. We celebrated Idd yesterday in England and I assume it is being celebrated today in my native country, India. May <strong>ALLAH s.w.t</strong> guide us all in the right path, Ameen.",
     "For me personally, the highlight of last week was the event organised by the <strong>Toronto Perl Mongers</strong>. It focussed on the new edition of the book, <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/datamungingwithperl\">Data Munging With Perl (2nd edition)</a>. Unfortunately I missed the event despite registering for it. However, I'm told the recording will be available soon. If you missed it too, don't worry, you will be to catch up soon.",
     "Speaking of the book, it is one of those must read classics for every <strong>Perl</strong> programmers. I read it, when it was first released, and I highly recommend you getting a copy to benefit from it.",
     "Last week, <strong>Gabor</strong> mentioned <strong>Ramadan</strong> seemed to have had positive impact on me as I started writing more frequently these days. He was absolutely right!. But now that <strong>Ramadan</strong> is over, I'm not sure if I'll continue at the same pace. That said, I truly enjoyed this little burst of writing. It felt like therapy to me. It allowed me to share whatever was on my mind at the time. And when I receive encouraging responses, it gives me even more motivation to keep going.",
     "I wrote few pieces last week, all of which are listed below. Please do check them out and share your thoughts.",
     "I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank, <strong>brian d foy</strong> for his incredible book: <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/perl_new_features\">Perl new features</a>. I have shared my take on some of the topics discussed in the book, and I highly recommend getting a copy. The latest edition has been updated to cover <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>.",
     "This edition of the newsletter is packed with positive <strong>Perl</strong> news, so take your time and enjoy.",
     "Happy Monday!!"
