      "Hi there",
      "If you are fan of MetaCPAN, like me, then you must have noticed the latest changes to <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/\">MetaCPAN</a> site. It is the introduction of new metric, \"CPAN Bus Factor\". Don't know what I am talking about? Well then you should read the <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2021/06/30/cpan-bus-factor/\">blog</a>, which is the collaborative work by Neil Bowers and Olaf Alders.",
      "It reminds me an incident from the past when I received an email from Neil Bowers about one of my CPAN distribution, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/IP::Info\">IP::Info</a> as he was reviewing CPAN modules for locating an IP address. Later he published his <a href=\"http://neilb.org/reviews/ip-location.html\">report</a> on 8th Aug 2012. You can take a look collection of <a href=\"http://neilb.org/reviews/\">CPAN module reviews</a> by him. If my memory serves better, Neil also ran <a href=\"http://cpan-weekly.org/\">CPAN Weekly</a>, for some times. I did join the mailing list and received CPAN Weekly newsletter talking about a CPAN module and it's usage every week. Unfortunately it is no longer active.",
      "Long time ago, I used to be an active CPAN contributor. Unfortunately because of time constraint, I no longer remain as active as I used to be. I even wrote 2-parts blog on the subject \"How to become a CPAN contributor?\" for perl.com in 2018. You can checkout the blogs, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/\">Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor-part-2/\">Part 2</a>, if you are interested.",
      "Why am I talking about CPAN contribution?",
      "A friend of mine and fellow contributor to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a>, Cheok-Yin Fung, wrote a <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2021/07/how-i-uploaded-a-cpan-module.html\">blog</a> about her experience on uploading her first distribution on CPAN. It reminds me of my early days of struggle with CPAN. These days there are so many help available on various public platforms. I wish her all the best and welcome to the club of CPAN contributors.",
      "I came across a very interesting <a href=\"https://medium.com/codex/how-to-create-awesome-pull-requests-b634e7f00e47z\">blog</a> by JJ Merelo talking about Pull Request do's and don'ts. A very helpful advice for anyone looking to contribute to opensource projects in general.",
      "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
